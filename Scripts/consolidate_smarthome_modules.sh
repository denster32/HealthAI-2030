# SmartHome Module

This is the consolidated SmartHome module for HealthAI-2030, combining all smart home and health automation functionality into a single, well-organized package.

## Structure

- **Models/**: Data models for smart home devices and automations
- **Managers/**: Core smart home management functionality
- **Views/**: UI components for smart home features
- **Integration/**: HomeKit and device integration logic
- **HealthAutomation/**: Health-focused automation engines
- **EnvironmentalHealth/**: Environmental health monitoring

## Features

- HomeKit integration for health-focused automation
- Environmental health monitoring (air quality, temperature, humidity)
- Sleep-optimized home automation
- Stress-responsive environmental adjustments
- Smart device health integration

## Migration Notes

This module consolidates functionality from:
- Packages/FeatureModules/SmartHomeHealth/
- Sources/Features/SmartHome/
- Modules/Features/SmartHome/
- Various SmartHome managers from Core and Services

All duplicate code has been removed and the best implementations have been preserved.
