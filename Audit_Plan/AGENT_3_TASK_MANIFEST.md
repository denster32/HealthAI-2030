# Agent 3 Task Manifest: Code Quality & Refactoring Champion

**Agent:** 3
**Role:** Code Quality & Refactoring Champion
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

This document outlines your expanded tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on elevating the code quality, architectural integrity, and maintainability of the HealthAI-2030 application.

## Week 1: Deep Audit and Strategic Analysis (July 14-18)

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QUAL-001 | **Code Style Enforcement & SwiftLint Integration:** Establish a strict, shared `.swiftlint.yml` configuration. Integrate SwiftLint into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce code style automatically on every commit. | A pull request with the `.swiftlint.yml` file, initial auto-corrections, and a report of major style violations that require manual fixing. |
| QUAL-002 | **Code Complexity Analysis & Strategic Refactoring:** Use tools like SonarQube and manual inspection to identify areas of high cyclomatic complexity, low cohesion, and high coupling. Develop a strategic refactoring plan. | A prioritized backlog of refactoring tasks, each with a clear rationale and a proposed approach (e.g., "Extract Class," "Replace Delegate with Closure"). |
| QUAL-003 | **API Design Review & Architectural Pattern Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review of all public and internal APIs for clarity, consistency, and adherence to Swift API Design Guidelines. Analyze the existing architecture and identify any deviations from established patterns (e.g., MVVM, VIPER). | A document with detailed recommendations for API improvements and architectural adjustments to improve consistency and maintainability. |
| QUAL-004 | **Documentation Audit & DocC Implementation:** Audit all existing documentation for accuracy and completeness. Plan the migration of all relevant documentation to DocC to enable integration with Xcode's documentation viewer. | A report on the state of the documentation and a plan for migrating to and maintaining DocC documentation. |
| QUAL-005 | **Dead Code Identification and Removal:** Use tools and manual analysis to identify and flag all unused or unreachable code, including old feature flags, deprecated classes, and unused methods. | A report of all identified dead code and a plan for its safe removal. |

## Week 2: Intensive Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25)

| Task ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QUAL-FIX-001 | **Enforce Code Style:** Manually address all remaining SwiftLint violations and ensure the CI/CD pipeline correctly enforces the style guide. |
| QUAL-FIX-002 | **Execute Refactoring Plan:** Begin executing the strategic refactoring plan, starting with the highest-priority tasks. |
| QUAL-FIX-003 | **Improve API and Architecture:** Apply the recommended changes to improve API design and architectural consistency. |
| QUAL-FIX-004 | **Migrate to DocC:** Begin the migration of existing documentation to DocC and write new documentation for undocumented areas. |
| QUAL-FIX-005 | **Remove Dead Code:** Safely remove all identified dead code from the codebase. |

Submit all changes as pull requests for peer review.
