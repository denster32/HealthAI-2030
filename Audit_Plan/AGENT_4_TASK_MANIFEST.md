# Agent 4 Task Manifest: Testing & Reliability Engineer

**Agent:** 4
**Role:** Testing & Reliability Engineer
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

This document outlines your expanded tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on dramatically improving test coverage, implementing advanced testing strategies, and ensuring the rock-solid reliability of the HealthAI-2030 application.

## Week 1: Deep Audit and Strategic Analysis (July 14-18)

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEST-001 | **Test Coverage Analysis & Expansion:** Use Xcode's code coverage tools to perform a detailed analysis of both unit and UI test coverage. Identify critical gaps and develop a strategy to increase coverage to at least 85%. | A comprehensive test coverage report, a prioritized list of areas for new tests, and a plan to achieve the target coverage percentage. |
| TEST-002 | **UI Test Automation & End-to-End Scenario Testing:** Overhaul the existing UI test suite for maximum stability and coverage. Implement new end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, including edge cases and error conditions. | A report on the state of the UI test suite, a plan for its enhancement, and a set of new, robust end-to-end test cases. |
| TEST-003 | **Bug Triage, Prioritization, and Formal Reporting Process:** Review and triage the entire bug backlog. Establish a formal, documented process for bug reporting, triage, and prioritization to be used by the entire team going forward. | An updated and prioritized bug backlog, and a document detailing the new bug triage and reporting process. |
| TEST-004 | **Cross-Platform Consistency & Property-Based Testing:** Perform rigorous testing across all platforms to identify inconsistencies. Introduce property-based testing (using a library like SwiftCheck) to test the properties of your code that should hold true for all inputs. | A report on all identified platform inconsistencies and a set of new property-based tests for critical components. |
| TEST-005 | **CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Testing:** Design and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions that automatically builds the project, runs all unit and UI tests, and generates a code coverage report on every pull request. | A fully configured CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire testing process. |

## Week 2: Intensive Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25)

| Task ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TEST-FIX-001 | **Write New Tests:** Execute the plan to increase test coverage, writing new unit and UI tests for critical areas. |
| TEST-FIX-002 | **Enhance UI Test Suite:** Implement the plan to improve the UI test suite, fixing flaky tests and adding new end-to-end scenarios. |
| TEST-FIX-003 | **Fix High-Priority Bugs:** Begin fixing the highest-priority bugs from the newly triaged backlog. |
| TEST-FIX-004 | **Address Inconsistencies and Implement Property-Based Tests:** Work with the team to resolve platform inconsistencies and implement the new property-based tests. |
| TEST-FIX-005 | **Deploy and Validate CI/CD Pipeline:** Deploy the new CI/CD pipeline and ensure it is functioning correctly for all new pull requests. |

Submit all changes as pull requests for peer review.
