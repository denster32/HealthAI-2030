  - Trust-building messages (e.g., 'Your data is secure with end-to-end encryption').
- **Accessibility:**
  - Audio prompts for each step.
  - High-contrast visuals for status indicators.

### 2. Facial Recognition with Liveness Detection
- **Purpose:** Ensure secure access by verifying user identity with facial recognition and anti-spoofing measures.
- **Key Features:**
  - Visual guide for face positioning within camera frame.
  - Liveness detection prompts (e.g., 'Blink twice' or 'Turn head slightly').
  - Immediate feedback on recognition success or failure.
- **Design Elements:**
  - Oval frame overlay to guide face alignment.
  - Subtle animation cues for liveness actions (e.g., blinking eye icon).
  - Color-coded feedback (green for success, red for retry).
