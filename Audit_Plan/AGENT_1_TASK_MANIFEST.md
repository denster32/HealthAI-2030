# Agent 1 Task Manifest: Security & Dependencies Czar

**Agent:** 1
**Role:** Security & Dependencies Czar
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

This document outlines your expanded tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on a deep-dive security audit and robust dependency management for the HealthAI-2030 application.

## Week 1: Deep Audit and Strategic Analysis (July 14-18) ✅ COMPLETE

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SEC-001 | **Dependency Vulnerability Scan & Management:** Conduct a thorough audit of all third-party dependencies using `swift package show-dependencies` and vulnerability databases (NVD, GitHub Advisories). Set up Dependabot for automated future scanning. | A detailed report of vulnerable dependencies, their severity, and a strategic plan for remediation (update, replace, or mitigate). | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-002 | **Advanced Static & Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Configure and run advanced SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube) and explore options for DAST to identify a broader range of security flaws, including those in running application instances. | A comprehensive, prioritized list of all identified vulnerabilities, categorized by type (e.g., Injection, XSS, Insecure Deserialization) and severity. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-003 | **Secure Coding Practices & Data Encryption Review:** Perform a manual review of critical code sections, focusing on input validation, output encoding, and data encryption. Verify that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest (using `NSFileProtectionComplete`) and in transit (using TLS with certificate pinning). | A detailed document with findings, code snippets illustrating vulnerabilities, and concrete recommendations for implementing stronger security controls. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-004 | **Secrets Management & API Key Security Audit:** Systematically search the codebase for any hardcoded secrets. Review the current secrets management strategy and identify weaknesses. | A report on the current state of secrets management and a detailed migration plan to move all secrets to a secure solution like HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault, integrated with the CI/CD pipeline. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-005 | **Authentication and Authorization Review:** Analyze the existing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Identify any potential weaknesses, such as insecure token handling or improper access control. | A report on the current authentication/authorization implementation and a plan to strengthen it, potentially by implementing OAuth 2.0 with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). | ✅ COMPLETE |

## Week 2: Intensive Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25) ✅ COMPLETE

| Task ID | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEC-FIX-001 | **Remediate Vulnerable Dependencies:** Execute the dependency remediation plan. Update, replace, or mitigate all identified vulnerabilities. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-FIX-002 | **Fix High-Priority Security Flaws:** Address all critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified by SAST/DAST scans. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-FIX-003 | **Implement Enhanced Security Controls:** Apply the recommended changes from the secure coding and encryption review. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-FIX-004 | **Migrate to Secure Secrets Management:** Implement the plan to migrate all hardcoded secrets to a secure, centralized vault. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| SEC-FIX-005 | **Strengthen Authentication/Authorization:** Implement the proposed enhancements to the authentication and authorization systems. | ✅ COMPLETE |
