# HealthAI 2030 M2 – Beta Milestone Plan

This plan outlines the architectural and high-level UI/UX components for the HealthAI 2030 M2 – Beta milestone, focusing on the Enhanced ECG Insight Stack, Predictive Health-Alert System, and Vision Pro Biofeedback Scene.

## 1. Enhanced ECG Insight Stack

The "Enhanced ECG Insight Stack" will leverage both scheduled 30-second captures and opportunistic background snippets during sedentary moments. This stack will integrate with existing data ingestion (`HealthDataManager`) and ML models (`MLModelManager`).

### 1.1. Architectural Components

The core of the ECG Insight Stack will involve a new `ECGInsightManager.swift` responsible for orchestrating the various ECG analysis modules. Each insight will likely have its own dedicated ML model or analytical component.

*   **Data Ingestion & Pre-processing:**
    *   `HealthDataManager.swift`: Enhanced to handle continuous ECG data streams and opportunistic captures.
    *   `MLModelManager.swift`: Extended to include specific pre-processing functions for ECG data (filtering, normalization, segmentation) tailored for each insight.
    *   New `ECGDataProcessor.swift`: A dedicated utility class for advanced signal processing and feature extraction from raw ECG data.

*   **Insight Modules (within `ML/` or a new `ECG/` directory):**

    *   **Beat-Morphology Fingerprint:**
        *   **Functionality:** Utilizes a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to cluster QRS shapes. Outliers are scored for ischemic risk.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `BeatMorphologyAnalyzer.swift`: Contains the VAE model and logic for QRS complex detection, feature extraction (e.g., amplitude, duration, morphology features), and clustering.
            *   `IschemicRiskScorer.swift`: Interprets VAE outlier scores to generate an ischemic risk assessment.
        *   **Integration:** Receives pre-processed ECG segments from `ECGDataProcessor`.

    *   **HR-Turbulence Index:**
        *   **Functionality:** Calculates post-PVC acceleration/deceleration metrics to signal early autonomic dysfunction.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `HRTurbulenceCalculator.swift`: Identifies PVCs and computes heart rate acceleration and deceleration phases following a PVC.
        *   **Integration:** Requires beat-to-beat heart rate data and PVC annotations, potentially from `HealthDataManager` or a preliminary rhythm analysis module.

    *   **QT-Dynamic Map:**
        *   **Functionality:** Analyzes QT-vs-RR slope across circadian span; flattened slope flags drug or electrolyte imbalance.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `QTDynamicAnalyzer.swift`: Extracts QT and RR intervals from ECG, constructs the QT-vs-RR plot, and calculates the slope.
            *   `CircadianRhythmTracker.swift`: (Potentially existing or new) Provides context on time of day for circadian span analysis.
        *   **Integration:** Requires accurate QT and RR interval measurements from ECG.

    *   **Atrial-Fibrillation Forecast:**
        *   **Functionality:** A gradient-boosted hazard model predicts AF conversion within 30/60/90 days (AUC 0.88) using PAC density, P-wave dispersion, sleep-HRV, and LA-size proxy.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `AFForecastModel.swift`: Implements the gradient-boosted hazard model.
            *   `AFFeatureExtractor.swift`: Extracts features like PAC density, P-wave dispersion (from ECG), and integrates sleep-HRV (from `HealthDataManager` / `SleepOptimizationManager`) and LA-size proxy (requires external input or advanced imaging analysis, for M2, this might be a placeholder or derived from other metrics).
        *   **Integration:** Combines ECG analysis with sleep data and potentially other health metrics.

    *   **ST-Shift Early Ischemia Screen:**
        *   **Functionality:** Rolling z-score on ST-segment height; three consecutive > 2σ excursions during exertion prompt immediate resting ECG capture + optional EMS suggestion.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `STSegmentAnalyzer.swift`: Measures ST-segment height and calculates rolling z-scores.
            *   `ExertionDetector.swift`: (Potentially existing or new) Identifies periods of physical exertion (e.g., from accelerometer data via `HealthDataManager`).
            *   `EmergencyAlertManager.swift`: (New) Handles triggering immediate ECG capture and EMS suggestions.
        *   **Integration:** Requires continuous ECG monitoring and activity data.

### 2. Predictive Health-Alert System

The "Predictive Health-Alert System" will generate, prioritize, and present alerts to the user based on insights from various health data streams, including the new ECG insights. This system will be managed by an enhanced `PredictiveAnalyticsManager.swift`.

#### 2.1. Architectural Components

*   **Alert Generation:**
    *   `PredictiveAnalyticsManager.swift`: Centralizes the logic for receiving insights from various ML models and analytical components (e.g., `ECGInsightManager`, `SleepOptimizationManager`, `HealthDataManager`).
    *   New `AlertRuleEngine.swift`: Defines a set of configurable rules and thresholds for triggering alerts based on combined health metrics and predictive models.

*   **Alert Prioritization:**
    *   **Triage Rank:**
        *   **Functionality:** Assigns a severity and urgency rank to each generated alert.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `AlertPrioritizer.swift`: Implements a ranking algorithm considering factors like:
                *   Severity of the underlying health condition (e.g., immediate cardiac event vs. long-term trend).
                *   Confidence score from the predictive model.
                *   User's historical health data and risk factors.
                *   Contextual data (e.g., current activity level, time of day).
        *   **Output:** A `TriageRank` (e.g., Critical, Urgent, Advisory, Informational) and a numerical priority score.

*   **Alert Presentation:**
    *   **Explain-able AI Panel:**
        *   **Functionality:** Provides clear, concise explanations for why an alert was triggered, highlighting the key contributing factors.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `XAIExplanationGenerator.swift`: (New) A module that translates model outputs and rule triggers into human-readable explanations. This could involve:
                *   Identifying the most influential features for a prediction.
                *   Referencing the specific rules or thresholds that were crossed.
                *   Providing context from the user's health history.
        *   **UI/UX:** A dedicated UI component (e.g., a modal sheet or expandable card) within the app that displays the alert details and the XAI explanation.

    *   **One-tap Pathway:**
        *   **Functionality:** Offers immediate, actionable steps directly from the alert notification or within the app.
        *   **Components:**
            *   `ActionSuggester.swift`: (New) Based on the alert type and triage rank, suggests relevant actions (e.g., "Call EMS," "Consult Doctor," "Schedule Appointment," "Review Data," "Adjust Environment").
            *   `DeepLinkManager.swift`: (Existing or new) Facilitates one-tap navigation to relevant sections of the app (e.g., detailed ECG view, sleep settings) or external services (e.g., telehealth, emergency services).
        *   **UI/UX:** Prominent buttons or links associated with the alert, allowing for quick execution of suggested actions.

```

### 3. Vision Pro Biofeedback Scene

The "Biofeedback Meditations" scene for Vision Pro will provide an immersive mixed reality experience, focusing on visual and auditory feedback entrained to HRV coherence.

#### 3.1. High-Level UI/UX Design

*   **Scene Environment:**
    *   **Mixed Reality Integration:** The scene will blend digital elements seamlessly with the user's physical environment. This means the user will still see their room, but with overlaid generative visuals and audio.
    *   **Subtle Ambiance:** The physical room might be subtly dimmed or tinted to enhance focus on the biofeedback elements.

*   **Core Biofeedback Elements:**

    *   **Fractal Visuals + Generative Music Entrained to HRV Coherence:**
        *   **Visuals:**
            *   **Dynamic Fractals:** Abstract, organic fractal patterns will be rendered in 3D space, appearing to float or emanate from a central point in the user's field of view.
            *   **Coherence Entrainment:** The complexity, speed, color, and luminosity of the fractals will dynamically respond to the user's HRV coherence.
                *   *High Coherence:* Fractals become more intricate, vibrant, and fluid, creating a sense of calm and expansion.
                *   *Low Coherence:* Fractals might appear simpler, less vibrant, or slightly chaotic, subtly guiding the user towards better coherence.
            *   **Particle Effects:** Subtle particle systems (e.g., shimmering dust, gentle light trails) could enhance the visual feedback.
        *   **Generative Music:**
            *   **Adaptive Soundscapes:** Ambient, generative music will be composed in real-time, with parameters (e.g., tempo, harmony, instrument timbre, volume) directly influenced by HRV coherence.
            *   **Coherence Entrainment:**
                *   *High Coherence:* Music becomes more harmonious, flowing, and resonant, potentially introducing richer textures or calming melodies.
                *   *Low Coherence:* Music might become slightly dissonant, simpler, or have a more irregular rhythm, prompting the user to adjust their breathing.
            *   **Spatial Audio:** The music will utilize Vision Pro's spatial audio capabilities, creating an enveloping sound experience that feels integrated with the visual elements.

    *   **Breath Ring:**
        *   **Visual Representation:** A translucent, glowing ring will appear in the user's direct line of sight, perhaps floating slightly in front of them or around a central focal point.
        *   **Breathing Guidance:** The ring will expand and contract in a smooth, rhythmic motion, guiding the user's inhalation and exhalation.
            *   *Expansion:* Inhale.
            *   *Contraction:* Exhale.
        *   **HRV Coherence Feedback:** The color, glow intensity, or subtle pulsations of the Breath Ring will provide additional visual feedback on HRV coherence.
            *   *Optimal Coherence:* Ring glows with a steady, calming color (e.g., soft green, deep blue).
            *   *Improving Coherence:* Ring might subtly shift colors or increase in glow intensity.
        *   **Placement:** The ring should be positioned comfortably within the user's central field of view, allowing them to focus on it without strain.

*   **User Controls (Minimalist & Intuitive):**
    *   **Gaze-based Interaction:** Simple gaze-based interactions for starting/stopping the meditation or adjusting basic settings (e.g., music volume, visual intensity).
    *   **Hand Gestures:** Subtle hand gestures (e.g., pinch to pause, open palm to dismiss) for non-intrusive control.
    *   **On-demand Metrics:** A discreet, optional overlay (activated by gaze or gesture) could display real-time HRV coherence scores or other relevant biofeedback metrics.
