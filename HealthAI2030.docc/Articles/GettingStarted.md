# Getting Started with HealthAI 2030

Learn how to integrate and use the HealthAI 2030 platform in your health and wellness applications.

## Overview

HealthAI 2030 is a comprehensive health monitoring and analysis platform that provides:

- Real-time health data collection and analysis
- AI-powered health insights and recommendations
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Privacy-preserving data management
- Multi-platform support (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS)

## Quick Start

### 1. Add HealthAI 2030 to Your Project

Add the HealthAI 2030 package to your Xcode project:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/healthai/HealthAI-2030.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### 2. Import the Framework

```swift
import HealthAI2030
```

### 3. Initialize Core Services

```swift
// Initialize health data manager
let healthDataManager = HealthDataManager.shared

// Initialize performance monitor
let performanceMonitor = PerformanceMonitorCoordinator()

// Initialize AI recommendation engine
let recommendationEngine = AIRecommendationEngine()
```

### 4. Request Health Permissions

```swift
// Request HealthKit permissions
try await healthDataManager.requestHealthKitPermissions()
```

### 5. Start Monitoring

```swift
// Start performance monitoring
try await performanceMonitor.startMonitoring(interval: 2.0)

// Start health data collection
try await healthDataManager.startDataCollection()
```

## Core Concepts

### Health Data Management

The platform provides comprehensive health data management through the `HealthDataManager`:

```swift
// Collect health metrics
let metrics = await healthDataManager.collectHealthMetrics()

// Get health insights
let insights = await healthDataManager.generateHealthInsights()
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor system performance and get optimization recommendations:

```swift
// Access current metrics
let currentMetrics = performanceMonitor.currentMetrics

// Get optimization recommendations
let recommendations = performanceMonitor.optimizationRecommendations
```

### AI-Powered Recommendations

Get personalized health recommendations:

```swift
// Generate recommendations
let recommendations = await recommendationEngine.generateRecommendations(
    for: userProfile,
    context: healthContext
)
```
