# ECG Optimization Integration Checklist

## After Directory Reorganization Completes
1. Run integration script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x integrate_ecg_optimizations.sh
   ./integrate_ecg_optimizations.sh
   ```

2. In Xcode:
   - Add `ECGProcessorPerformanceTests.swift` to test target
   - Build project to ensure no compilation errors
   - Run all tests (Cmd+U)

3. Verify performance metrics:
   - Watch latency <50ms (testProcessingLatency)
   - Memory usage <15MB on Apple Watch (testMemoryFootprint)
   - Series 3 fallback performance (testCoreMLFallbackPerformance)

4. Manual validation:
   - Test on actual Apple Watch hardware
   - Verify real-time ECG processing in Health Monitoring View
   - Check error handling for memory constraints
