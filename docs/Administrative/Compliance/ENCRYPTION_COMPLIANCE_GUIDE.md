# HealthAI 2030 Encryption Compliance Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive information about encryption usage in HealthAI 2030 for App Store compliance and export regulations.

## Encryption Declaration Status

### ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: YES
The app uses encryption for protecting sensitive health data and secure communications.

## Encryption Technologies Used

### 1. Data-at-Rest Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Implementation**: CryptoKit framework
- **Purpose**: Protecting stored health data, user preferences, and biometric information
- **Location**: DataEncryptionService.swift

### 2. Data-in-Transit Encryption
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3
- **Implementation**: URLSession with default security settings
- **Purpose**: Secure API communications and CloudKit sync
- **Endpoints**: All HTTPS connections

### 3. Key Management
- **Storage**: iOS Keychain Services
- **Access Control**: kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly
- **Rotation**: 30-day automatic key rotation
- **Backup**: Encrypted key archival for data recovery

### 4. Biometric Data Protection
- **Framework**: LocalAuthentication + CryptoKit
- **Purpose**: Securing biometric templates and authentication tokens
- **Storage**: Secure Enclave when available

## Export Compliance Classification

### Category 5, Part 2 - Medical/Health Software
The app qualifies for exemption under medical software provisions:
- Primary purpose: Personal health management
- Encryption is ancillary to medical functionality
- Not designed for military or government use

### ECCN Classification
- **ECCN**: 5D992.c
- **License Exception**: ENC-Unrestricted
- **Reason**: Mass market software with standard encryption

## Compliance Requirements

### 1. Annual Self-Classification Report
Required to submit annual self-classification to BIS by February 1st:
- Product name: HealthAI 2030
- Encryption functionality: Data protection for health information
- Algorithms: AES-256-GCM, SHA-256

### 2. App Store Connect Requirements
```plist
<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<true/>
<key>ITSEncryptionExportComplianceCode</key>
<string>[COMPLIANCE_CODE]</string>
```

### 3. Documentation Requirements
Maintain records of:
- Encryption implementation details
- Export classification rationale
- Compliance code from Apple

## Obtaining Compliance Code

### Step 1: Submit Self-Classification
1. Go to [SNAP-R](https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/)
2. Create encryption registration
3. Select "5D992.c" classification
4. Submit annual report

### Step 2: App Store Connect
1. Navigate to App Information
2. Select "Encryption Documentation"
3. Answer compliance questions:
   - Uses encryption: YES
   - Exempt from ERN: YES (medical software)
   - Qualifies for exemption: YES
4. Receive compliance code

### Step 3: Update Info.plist
Replace `YOUR_COMPLIANCE_CODE` with the actual code from Apple.

## Encryption Implementation Details

### DataEncryptionService
```swift
// Location: /Modules/Core/HealthAI2030Core/Sources/Services/DataEncryptionService.swift
- Algorithm: AES.GCM with 256-bit keys
- IV Generation: Automatic (12 bytes)
- Authentication: Built-in AEAD
```

### Key Storage
```swift
// Keychain attributes:
- kSecClass: kSecClassKey
- kSecAttrKeyType: kSecAttrKeyTypeAES
- kSecAttrKeySizeInBits: 256
- kSecAttrAccessible: kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly
```

## Exemption Justification

### Medical Software Exemption (ยง740.17(b)(4)(iv))
1. **Primary Function**: Personal health monitoring and management
2. **Encryption Role**: Protecting patient privacy (HIPAA compliance)
3. **Not Controlled**: Not specially designed for military/government
4. **Mass Market**: Available on public App Store

### Standard Encryption Exemption
1. Uses only Apple-provided cryptographic APIs
2. No custom cryptographic implementations
3. Standard protocols (TLS, AES)
4. No key escrow or recovery mechanisms for third parties

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Annual self-classification report submitted
- [ ] Compliance code obtained from App Store Connect
- [ ] Info.plist updated with encryption keys
- [ ] Export compliance documentation maintained
- [ ] Encryption implementation documented
- [ ] Legal review completed
- [ ] Privacy policy updated with encryption disclosure

## Important Notes

1. **No Export to Embargoed Countries**: The app must not be made available in countries under U.S. embargo
2. **Update Compliance Code**: Required when encryption implementation changes significantly
3. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep all encryption-related documentation for 5 years
4. **Regular Review**: Review encryption compliance annually

## Contact Information

For encryption compliance questions:
- Apple: Use App Store Connect support
- BIS: Contact through SNAP-R system
