# 8.4 Post-Launch Maintenance & Evolution

## 8.4.1 User Feedback Loops
Establish multiple channels to capture user sentiment:
- Integrate in-app surveys using the `UserFeedbackManager` module to gather contextual feedback after major interactions.
- Monitor App Store reviews weekly and tag them in the issue tracker for triage.
- Summarize trends monthly and feed them into the product roadmap meetings.

## 8.4.2 Analytics-Driven Feature Prioritization
Leverage analytics to guide roadmap decisions:
- Track engagement and retention metrics via the HealthAI Analytics dashboard.
- Create KPI dashboards in Grafana for feature usage, crash rates, and funnel drop-off.
- Review metrics during sprint planning to prioritize high-impact improvements.

## 8.4.3 Security Patch & Framework Update Strategy
Maintain a consistent update cadence:
- Run `swift package update` and dependency vulnerability scans every month.
- Schedule quarterly framework upgrades and security audits with the security team.
- Document upgrade outcomes and any breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md.

## 8.4.4 Continuous Performance Monitoring
Ensure performance regressions are detected early:
- Instrument key flows with signposts and collect metrics via the telemetry service.
- Configure alerts for latency or crash spikes using the monitoring dashboard.
- Review performance reports in the bi-weekly engineering sync.

## 8.4.5 Technology Trends & Prototyping
Dedicate time for innovation:
- Allocate 10% of each development cycle for exploring emerging frameworks or hardware capabilities.
- Prototype promising ideas in the `Experimental` module and demo them during quarterly reviews.
