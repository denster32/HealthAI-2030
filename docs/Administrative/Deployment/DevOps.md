   - Trivy vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency security checks

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS)
   - Integration tests
   - UI tests
   - Performance tests

4. **Build & Archive**
   - Multi-platform builds
   - Code signing
   - IPA generation

5. **Documentation Generation**
   - API documentation
   - Code coverage reports
   - Release notes

6. **Deployment**
   - Staging (TestFlight)
   - Production (App Store)

### Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` - Pull request validation
- `.github/branch-protection.yml` - Branch protection rules
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership definitions

## Environment Setup

### Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Code Signing
CODE_SIGNING_P12=<base64-encoded-p12-file>
CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD=<p12-password>
TEAM_ID=<apple-team-id>
BUNDLE_ID=<app-bundle-identifier>
PROVISIONING_PROFILE=<provisioning-profile-name>

# App Store Connect
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY=<api-key>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID=<api-key-id>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=<issuer-id>

# GitHub
GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-token>
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
XCODE_VERSION: '15.2'
SWIFT_VERSION: '5.9'
IOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: '18.0'
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: '15.0'
```

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

**Trigger:** Push to `develop` branch or manual workflow dispatch

**Process:**
1. Run all tests and quality checks
2. Build and archive the application
3. Upload to TestFlight for testing
4. Notify team of successful deployment

**Access:** TestFlight internal testing group

### Production Deployment

**Trigger:** Push to `main` branch or manual workflow dispatch

**Process:**
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Build and archive with production signing
3. Upload to App Store Connect
4. Create GitHub release with changelog
5. Notify stakeholders

**Access:** App Store public release

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features

### Feature Development

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Pass all CI checks
5. Get code review approval
6. Merge to `develop`

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Create pull request to `main`
4. Pass all CI checks and reviews
5. Merge to `main` (triggers production deployment)

## Code Quality Enforcement

### SwiftLint Configuration

The project uses SwiftLint with custom rules:

```yaml
# Key rules enforced
- no_force_unwrapping
- no_print_statements
- no_force_cast
- line_length: 120
- function_body_length: 50
- type_body_length: 300
```

### Required Checks

**For Pull Requests:**
- Quick lint check
- Quick build check
- Quick test check
- Security scan

**For Main Branch:**
- Full lint analysis
- Comprehensive security scan
- All unit tests
- Integration tests
- UI tests
- Performance tests
- Documentation generation

## Security Measures

### Code Scanning

- **CodeQL Analysis:** Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Trivy Scanner:** Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **Dependency Review:** Automated dependency security checks

### Access Control

- Branch protection rules prevent direct pushes to main branches
- Required code reviews for all changes
- Code owner approval for critical paths
- Admin enforcement for main branch

### Secrets Management

- All sensitive data stored as GitHub secrets
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- Rotating API keys and certificates
- Secure code signing process

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring

- GitHub Actions status badges
- Automated notifications for failures
- Slack/Teams integration for alerts
- Email notifications for critical issues

### Deployment Monitoring

- TestFlight build status
- App Store Connect metrics
- Crash reporting integration
- Performance monitoring

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Always work on feature branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Write tests for new features**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API calls
   - UI tests for user flows

3. **Follow coding standards**
   - Use SwiftLint locally before committing
   - Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
   - Write clear commit messages

4. **Review code thoroughly**
   - Self-review before requesting review
   - Address all review comments
   - Test changes locally

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Test thoroughly before deployment**
   - Run all tests locally
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Verify critical user flows

2. **Monitor deployments**
   - Check TestFlight feedback
   - Monitor crash reports
   - Track performance metrics

3. **Rollback plan**
   - Keep previous version ready
   - Monitor for critical issues
   - Have rollback procedure documented

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Store secrets in GitHub
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities

3. **Follow least privilege principle**
   - Minimal required permissions
   - Regular access reviews
   - Secure API key management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**
- Check Xcode version compatibility
- Verify code signing setup
- Review dependency conflicts

**Test Failures:**
- Run tests locally first
- Check simulator availability
- Review test environment setup

**Deployment Failures:**
- Verify App Store Connect access
- Check code signing certificates
- Review provisioning profiles

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs**
   - Detailed error messages
   - Step-by-step execution
   - Environment information

2. **Reproduce locally**
   - Use same Xcode version
   - Match CI environment
   - Test with same data

3. **Review recent changes**
   - Check diff for issues
   - Verify dependency updates
   - Review configuration changes
