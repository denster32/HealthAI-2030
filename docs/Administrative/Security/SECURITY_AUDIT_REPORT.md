## 🟡 Security Gaps (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Enhanced Security Manager Placeholders
**File**: `Sources/Features/HealthAI2030Core/Sources/HealthAI2030Core/EnhancedSecurityManager.swift`

**Current Implementation**:
```swift
private func implementAIThreatDetection() async throws {
    print("Phase 1: Implementing AI Threat Detection...")
    print("Phase 1: AI Threat Detection implemented")
}
```

**Impact**: Low - These are advanced features beyond baseline security requirements
**Priority**: P3 - Future enhancement
**Recommendation**: Convert to actual implementations in future releases

### 2. Advanced Cryptography Placeholders
**File**: `Sources/HealthAI2030/Security/AdvancedEncryptionEngine.swift`

**Current Implementation**:
```swift
func encrypt(data: Data, algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithm, key: Data?) throws -> EncryptionResult {
    // Asymmetric encryption implementation would go here
    throw EncryptionError.unsupportedAlgorithm("Asymmetric encryption not implemented")
}
```

**Impact**: Low - Symmetric encryption (AES-256) is fully implemented and sufficient
**Priority**: P3 - Future enhancement
**Recommendation**: RSA and post-quantum algorithms can be added later
