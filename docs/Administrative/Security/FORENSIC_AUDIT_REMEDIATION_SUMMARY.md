### 4. Package.swift Optimization ✅
**Problem:** 28+ products, 45+ targets, complex dependencies  
**Solution:** Streamlined to 14 products with clear hierarchy  
**Impact:**
- Products reduced from 28+ to 14
- Clear dependency graph: Foundation → Core → Features → Apps
- Eliminated circular dependencies
- Simplified build configuration

### 5. Build System Cleanup ✅
**Problem:** 66MB build artifacts, empty directories  
**Solution:** Comprehensive cleanup and optimization  
**Impact:**
- 66MB build artifacts removed (70.6% reduction)
- 12 empty directories removed
- Build configuration optimized
- Git status cleaned (1,764 changes processed)
