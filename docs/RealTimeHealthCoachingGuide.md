## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- iOS 18.0+ or macOS 15.0+
- HealthKit framework
- CoreML framework
- AVFoundation framework

### Basic Setup

```swift
import HealthAI2030

// Initialize dependencies
let healthDataManager = HealthDataManager()
let predictionEngine = AdvancedHealthPredictionEngine()
let analyticsEngine = AnalyticsEngine()

// Create coaching engine
let coachingEngine = RealTimeHealthCoachingEngine(
    healthDataManager: healthDataManager,
    predictionEngine: predictionEngine,
    analyticsEngine: analyticsEngine
)
```

### Starting a Coaching Session

```swift
// Set a health goal
let goal = HealthGoal(
    type: .cardiovascularHealth,
    targetValue: 0.8,
    timeframe: .month,
    description: "Improve cardiovascular health"
)

// Start coaching session
let session = try await coachingEngine.startCoachingSession(goal: goal)
```

## Core Functionality

### Session Management

The coaching engine manages active coaching sessions with the following lifecycle:

1. **Session Creation**: Initialize with optional health goal
2. **Active Session**: Real-time coaching and recommendations
3. **User Interactions**: Process user feedback and questions
4. **Session Completion**: End session and calculate metrics

```swift
// Start session
let session = try await coachingEngine.startCoachingSession(goal: goal)

// End session
await coachingEngine.endCoachingSession()
```

### Recommendation Generation

The engine generates personalized health recommendations based on:

- Current health data from HealthKit
- Health predictions from the prediction engine
- User's health goals and preferences
- Historical interaction patterns

```swift
// Generate recommendations
let recommendations = try await coachingEngine.generateRecommendations(for: session)

// Process recommendations
for recommendation in recommendations {
    print("Title: \(recommendation.title)")
    print("Priority: \(recommendation.priority)")
    print("Estimated Time: \(recommendation.estimatedTime) minutes")
}
```

### User Interaction Processing

The engine processes various types of user interactions:

- **Goal Completion**: User achieves a health goal
- **Recommendation Followed**: User completes a recommendation
- **Health Data Updates**: New health data is available
- **Struggling**: User reports difficulty with a task
- **Questions**: User asks for guidance

```swift
// Process user interaction
let interaction = UserInteraction(
    type: .recommendationFollowed,
    message: "Completed 30 minutes of cardio",
    timestamp: Date(),
    metadata: ["duration": "30", "intensity": "moderate"]
)

let response = try await coachingEngine.processUserInteraction(interaction)
print("Coach Response: \(response.message)")
```

### Voice Coaching

The engine provides voice coaching using AVSpeechSynthesizer:

```swift
// Provide voice coaching
await coachingEngine.provideVoiceCoaching("Great job on completing your exercise today!")
```

## Data Models

### CoachingSession

Represents an active or completed coaching session:

```swift
public class CoachingSession: ObservableObject {
    public let id: UUID
    public let startTime: Date
    public var endTime: Date?
    public let goal: HealthGoal?
    public var status: SessionStatus
    public var recommendations: [HealthRecommendation]
    public var interactions: [UserInteraction]
    public var metrics: SessionMetrics?
}
```

### HealthRecommendation

Represents a personalized health recommendation:

```swift
public struct HealthRecommendation: Identifiable, Codable {
    public let type: RecommendationType
    public let title: String
    public let description: String
    public let priority: Priority
    public let estimatedTime: Int
    public let difficulty: Difficulty
    public let category: Category
}
```

### HealthGoal

Represents a user's health goal:

```swift
public struct HealthGoal: Identifiable, Codable {
    public let type: HealthGoalType
    public let targetValue: Double
    public let timeframe: Timeframe
    public let description: String
}
```

### UserInteraction

Represents a user interaction with the coaching system:

```swift
public struct UserInteraction: Identifiable, Codable {
    public let type: InteractionType
    public let message: String?
    public let timestamp: Date
    public let metadata: [String: String]
}
```

## UI Integration

### RealTimeCoachingDashboardView

The main coaching interface provides:

- Current session status and progress
- Active recommendations with priority indicators
- User interaction interface
- Progress metrics and analytics
- Quick actions and shortcuts

```swift
RealTimeCoachingDashboardView(
    healthDataManager: healthDataManager,
    predictionEngine: predictionEngine,
    analyticsEngine: analyticsEngine
)
```

### GoalSettingView

Interface for setting and configuring health goals:

```swift
GoalSettingView(coachingEngine: coachingEngine)
```

### CoachingInsightsView

Analytics and insights dashboard:

```swift
CoachingInsightsView(coachingEngine: coachingEngine)
```

### RecommendationDetailView

Detailed view for individual recommendations:

```swift
RecommendationDetailView(
    recommendation: recommendation,
    coachingEngine: coachingEngine
)
```

## Integration with Health Dashboard

The coaching engine integrates seamlessly with the main Health Dashboard:

```swift
// Add coaching card to dashboard
HealthCoachingCard {
    showingCoachingDashboard = true
}

// Present coaching dashboard as sheet
.sheet(isPresented: $showingCoachingDashboard) {
    RealTimeCoachingDashboardView(
        healthDataManager: healthDataManager,
        predictionEngine: predictionEngine,
        analyticsEngine: analyticsEngine
    )
}
```

## Analytics and Insights

### CoachingInsights

Provides comprehensive analytics:

```swift
let insights = await coachingEngine.getCoachingInsights()

print("Total Sessions: \(insights.totalSessions)")
print("Success Rate: \(insights.successRate * 100)%")
print("Average Duration: \(insights.averageSessionDuration) minutes")
print("Most Common Goals: \(insights.mostCommonGoals)")
```

### Progress Metrics

Track user progress over time:

```swift
let metrics = coachingEngine.progressMetrics

print("Total Sessions: \(metrics.totalSessions)")
print("Total Duration: \(metrics.totalDuration)")
print("Recommendations Followed: \(metrics.totalRecommendationsFollowed)")
print("Average Goal Progress: \(metrics.averageGoalProgress * 100)%")
```

## Error Handling

The coaching engine provides comprehensive error handling:

```swift
enum CoachingError: Error {
    case noActiveSession
    case invalidGoal
    case recommendationGenerationFailed
    case sessionCreationFailed
}

// Handle errors
do {
    let session = try await coachingEngine.startCoachingSession()
} catch CoachingError.noActiveSession {
    print("No active coaching session")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Async/Await**: All operations use async/await for non-blocking execution
2. **Actor Model**: Thread-safe state management using Swift actors
3. **Lazy Loading**: Recommendations and insights loaded on-demand
4. **Caching**: Session data and recommendations cached for performance
5. **Background Processing**: Heavy computations moved to background queues

### Memory Management

- Automatic cleanup of completed sessions
- Efficient data structures for large recommendation sets
- Proper disposal of AVSpeechSynthesizer resources

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Session management
- Recommendation generation
- User interaction processing
- Error handling
- Performance benchmarks

```swift
// Run tests
swift test --filter RealTimeHealthCoachingEngineTests
```

### Integration Tests

Test integration with:

- HealthKit data sources
- Prediction engine
- Analytics system

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

- All health data encrypted in transit and at rest
- User interactions anonymized for analytics
- Secure storage of coaching session data
- Privacy-compliant data handling

### Access Control

- User consent required for health data access
- Granular permissions for different data types
- Secure API key management
- Audit logging for data access

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

```swift
// Configure coaching engine
coachingEngine.configure(
    voiceEnabled: true,
    analyticsEnabled: true,
    privacyMode: .standard
)
```

### Customization Options
