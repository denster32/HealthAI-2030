# Federated Learning Architecture Guide

This document details the architecture of the federated learning system used in the Federated Health Intelligence Network.  It covers the key components, their interactions, and the various protocols and algorithms employed to ensure secure and efficient model training and prediction across multiple devices.

## Core Components

The federated learning system comprises three primary components:

1.  **FederatedNeuralNetwork:** This component represents the shared neural network model that is trained collaboratively across the network.  It defines the model's architecture, layers, activation functions, and optimization parameters.  The `FederatedNeuralNetwork` is designed to be adaptable to various health data inputs and prediction tasks.

2.  **FederatedLearningCoordinator:** This component orchestrates the federated learning process.  It is responsible for device discovery and pairing, secure communication, model parameter synchronization, gradient aggregation, model versioning and rollback, cross-device model validation, model update scheduling, conflict resolution, and anomaly detection.

3.  **FederatedHealthPredictor:** This component utilizes the trained `FederatedNeuralNetwork` to make predictions on individual devices.  It receives input data from the device, preprocesses it, feeds it to the model, and generates predictions.  It also handles multi-device prediction aggregation, confidence scoring, and personalized model adaptation.

## Model Parameter Synchronization Protocol

The model parameter synchronization protocol ensures that all participating devices have a consistent view of the shared model.  The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` periodically broadcasts the latest model parameters to all registered devices.  Devices then train the model locally using their own data and send back model updates (gradients) to the coordinator.

## Gradient Aggregation Algorithms

The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` employs robust gradient aggregation algorithms to combine model updates from different devices.  These algorithms consider factors such as device reliability, data quality, and update frequency to mitigate the impact of noisy or malicious updates.  The aggregated gradients are then used to update the global model.

## Model Versioning and Rollback System

The system incorporates a model versioning and rollback system to track model updates and revert to previous versions if necessary.  Each model update is assigned a unique version number, and the `FederatedLearningCoordinator` maintains a history of all model versions.  This allows for easy rollback to a previous version in case of performance degradation or unexpected behavior.

## Cross-Device Model Validation

Cross-device model validation ensures that the trained model generalizes well across different devices and data distributions.  The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` evaluates the model's performance on a held-out validation set from each device and aggregates the results to assess overall model performance.

## Device Discovery and Pairing

The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` handles device discovery and pairing through a secure protocol.  Devices broadcast their availability and the coordinator establishes secure connections with eligible devices.  The pairing process involves authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized participation.

## Secure Communication Protocols

Secure communication protocols are employed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between devices and the `FederatedLearningCoordinator`.  All communication channels are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

## Model Update Scheduling

The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` determines the optimal schedule for model updates based on factors such as network connectivity, device availability, and data freshness.  The update schedule aims to minimize communication overhead while maximizing model improvement.

## Conflict Resolution Algorithms

Conflict resolution algorithms address potential conflicts that may arise during model updates.  These algorithms consider the timestamps and priorities of conflicting updates to ensure consistent model convergence.

## Multi-Device Prediction Aggregation

The `FederatedHealthPredictor` aggregates predictions from multiple devices to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.  The aggregation process considers device confidence scores and data quality to weigh predictions appropriately.

## Confidence Scoring

The `FederatedHealthPredictor` assigns confidence scores to its predictions based on factors such as model uncertainty and data quality.  These scores provide an indication of the reliability of the predictions.

## Anomaly Detection

The system incorporates anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual patterns or outliers in the data.  The `FederatedLearningCoordinator` monitors model updates and device behavior to detect potential anomalies and trigger appropriate actions.

## Personalized Model Adaptation

The `FederatedHealthPredictor` adapts the shared model to individual devices based on user-specific data and preferences.  This personalization enhances prediction accuracy and relevance for each user.

## Testing Strategy

The federated learning system is thoroughly tested using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.  Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components, integration tests assess the interactions between components, and end-to-end tests evaluate the overall system performance.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
./run_tests.sh FederatedLearning
```

This command will execute all unit tests for the federated learning components and report the results.
