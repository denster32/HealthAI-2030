# Federated Learning UI Guide

## Architecture

The Federated Learning UI is built using SwiftUI and follows a modular architecture.  The main components include:

*   **FederatedLearningDashboard:** Displays network health, model performance, privacy compliance, and learning progress.
*   **FederatedNetworkView:** Visualizes the device network, connection status, data flow, and performance analytics.
*   **PrivacyControlsView:** Manages privacy settings, data sharing controls, compliance monitoring, and privacy score.

## Components

### FederatedLearningDashboard

This view provides an overview of the federated learning system's health and performance.

### FederatedNetworkView

This view displays a map of the device network and provides insights into data flow and performance.

### PrivacyControlsView

This view allows users to manage privacy settings and monitor compliance.

## Testing Strategy

UI component tests are implemented using XCTest to ensure the functionality and correctness of the UI elements.  The tests cover different user scenarios and edge cases.
