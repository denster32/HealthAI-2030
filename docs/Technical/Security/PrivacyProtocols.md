# Privacy-Preserving Protocol for Federated Health Intelligence Network

This document details the privacy-preserving protocol implemented for secure model updates within the Federated Health Intelligence Network.

## Algorithms and Techniques

The following algorithms and techniques are employed to ensure data privacy and security:

*   **Homomorphic Encryption:** Allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. This is crucial for preserving the confidentiality of sensitive health information during federated learning.  Our implementation leverages the *partially homomorphic* Paillier cryptosystem, which supports addition and multiplication on ciphertexts.  This allows us to aggregate encrypted model updates without revealing individual contributions.

*   **Differential Privacy:** Adds noise to datasets or model updates to protect individual privacy.  We use the Laplace mechanism to inject calibrated noise, ensuring that the presence or absence of a single data point does not significantly alter the aggregated results.  The privacy parameter (epsilon) controls the level of noise added, balancing privacy with model accuracy.

*   **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Enables joint computation on private data from multiple parties without revealing their individual inputs.  We utilize a variant of the Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme for MPC, allowing devices to collaboratively compute aggregate statistics without sharing raw data.

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Allow verification of health insights without revealing the underlying data.  ZKPs are used to prove the validity of model updates without disclosing the actual data used to generate them.  Our implementation uses non-interactive ZKPs based on elliptic curve cryptography.

*   **Federated Averaging with Noise Injection:** Averages model updates from multiple devices while preserving privacy.  Each device trains a local model on its private data and submits an encrypted, differentially private update.  These updates are then aggregated using homomorphic encryption and averaged to produce a global model update.

## Compliance Considerations

The protocol adheres to the following regulations:

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  The protocol ensures data minimization, purpose limitation, and data security, aligning with GDPR principles.  User consent is obtained for data collection and processing, and individuals have the right to access, rectify, and erase their data.

*   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):**  The protocol safeguards protected health information (PHI) through encryption, de-identification, and access controls, complying with HIPAA requirements.  Data is stored and transmitted securely, and audit trails are maintained for accountability.

```swift
// Example of applying differential privacy to a model update
let epsilon = 0.1 // Privacy parameter
let noisyUpdate = applyDifferentialPrivacy(data: modelUpdate, epsilon: epsilon)
```
