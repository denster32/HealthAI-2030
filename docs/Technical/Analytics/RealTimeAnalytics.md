# Real-Time Analytics Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the real-time federated analytics component within the Federated Health Intelligence Network.  This component is crucial for providing instant insights, detecting anomalies, and enabling live health optimization.

## Architecture

The real-time analytics component is designed to process continuous streams of health data from multiple devices.  It leverages a distributed stream processing architecture, where each device performs local computations, and the aggregated results are securely shared and analyzed in a federated manner.

```swift
// Example from RealTimeFederatedAnalytics.swift
func processHealthStream(data: HealthData) {
    // Perform local computations on the health data stream
    let localInsights = analyzeHealthData(data)

    // Securely share local insights with the federated network
    shareInsights(localInsights)
}
```

## Algorithms

The core algorithms used in this component include:

*   **Stream Processing:**  Utilizes a sliding window approach to analyze data within a specific time frame.
*   **Health Trend Detection:** Employs time series analysis techniques to identify trends and patterns in health data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Leverages statistical methods to detect deviations from normal behavior and trigger alerts.
*   **Health Optimization:**  Uses reinforcement learning to provide personalized recommendations for improving health outcomes.

## Functionalities

The real-time analytics component provides the following key functionalities:

*   **Real-time Health Trend Detection:**  Identifies emerging health trends across the federated network.
*   **Instant Anomaly Alerts:**  Triggers immediate alerts for abnormal health events.
*   **Live Health Optimization:**  Provides personalized recommendations for optimizing health in real-time.

## Data Flow and Interactions

The data flows from individual devices through the federated data pipeline to the real-time analytics component.  The component then interacts with the health insights engine to generate actionable insights and with the agent collaboration network to share insights and coordinate actions.

```
[Device] --> [Federated Data Pipeline] --> [Real-Time Analytics] --> [Health Insights Engine]
                                                                  |
                                                                  V
                                                          [Agent Collaboration Network]
```

## Testing

The testing strategy for the real-time analytics component involves unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.  Unit tests cover individual functions and algorithms, integration tests verify the interactions between components, and performance tests evaluate the scalability and efficiency of the system.

To run the tests, navigate to the `FederatedLearning` directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme FederatedLearning -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
