## Testing

### Unit Tests

```swift
// Test research engine initialization
func testInitialization() {
    let researchEngine = AdvancedHealthResearchEngine(
        healthDataManager: healthDataManager,
        analyticsEngine: analyticsEngine
    )
    
    XCTAssertNotNil(researchEngine)
    XCTAssertFalse(researchEngine.isResearchActive)
    XCTAssertEqual(researchEngine.researchProgress, 0.0)
}

// Test research start/stop
func testResearchControl() async throws {
    try await researchEngine.startResearch()
    XCTAssertTrue(researchEngine.isResearchActive)
    
    await researchEngine.stopResearch()
    XCTAssertFalse(researchEngine.isResearchActive)
}

// Test research insights
func testResearchInsights() async {
    let insights = await researchEngine.getResearchInsights()
    XCTAssertNotNil(insights)
    XCTAssertNotNil(insights.studyParticipation)
    XCTAssertNotNil(insights.trialEligibility)
}
```

### Integration Tests

```swift
// Test complete research workflow
func testResearchWorkflow() async throws {
    // Start research
    try await researchEngine.startResearch()
    
    // Perform research
    let activity = try await researchEngine.performResearch()
    XCTAssertNotNil(activity)
    
    // Get insights
    let insights = await researchEngine.getResearchInsights()
    XCTAssertNotNil(insights)
    
    // Join study
    let study = createMockStudy()
    try await researchEngine.joinResearchStudy(study)
    
    // Stop research
    await researchEngine.stopResearch()
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Asynchronous Operations**: All research operations are asynchronous for better performance
2. **Data Caching**: Research data is cached to reduce redundant computations
3. **Batch Processing**: Multiple operations are batched for efficiency
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup

### Monitoring

```swift
// Monitor research performance
let startTime = Date()
try await researchEngine.startResearch()
let activity = try await researchEngine.performResearch()
let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)

// Should complete within reasonable time
XCTAssertLessThan(duration, 5.0)
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All research data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls for research data
- **Anonymization**: Personal data is anonymized for research purposes
- **Compliance**: HIPAA and GDPR compliance for health data

### Privacy Features

```swift
// Export data with privacy controls
let exportData = try await researchEngine.exportResearchData(format: .json)

// Data is automatically anonymized and encrypted
// Personal identifiers are removed or encrypted
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

```swift
// Handle research start errors
do {
    try await researchEngine.startResearch()
} catch {
    print("Research start failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

// Handle study enrollment errors
do {
    try await researchEngine.joinResearchStudy(study)
} catch {
    print("Study enrollment failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

// Handle trial enrollment errors
do {
    try await researchEngine.enrollInClinicalTrial(trial)
} catch {
    print("Trial enrollment failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

### Error Recovery

```swift
// Retry mechanism for failed operations
func retryResearchOperation<T>(_ operation: () async throws -> T, maxRetries: Int = 3) async throws -> T {
    var lastError: Error?
    
    for attempt in 1...maxRetries {
        do {
            return try await operation()
        } catch {
            lastError = error
            if attempt < maxRetries {
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(pow(2.0, Double(attempt))) * 1_000_000_000)
            }
        }
    }
    
    throw lastError ?? NSError(domain: "ResearchError", code: -1, userInfo: nil)
}
```
