## Features
- Set and manage multiple health goals (steps, calories, sleep, mindfulness, water, custom)
- Track progress and completion status
- View analytics (completion rate, streak, average progress)
- Integrate with user profile and analytics systems
- SwiftUI interface for goal management and visualization

## Usage

### Creating a Goal
```swift
let goal = HealthGoalEngineManager.HealthGoal(
    title: "10k Steps",
    description: "Walk 10,000 steps daily",
    type: .steps,
    targetValue: 10000,
    unit: "steps",
    userId: "user123"
)
HealthGoalEngineManager.shared.createGoal(goal)
```

### Updating Progress
```swift
HealthGoalEngineManager.shared.updateProgress(goalId: goal.id, value: 5000)
```

### Viewing Progress and Analytics
```swift
let progress = HealthGoalEngineManager.shared.getProgress(goalId: goal.id)
let analytics = HealthGoalEngineManager.shared.getAnalytics(goalId: goal.id)
```

### Listing Goals for a User
```swift
let userGoals = HealthGoalEngineManager.shared.goalsForUser(userId: "user123")
```

### SwiftUI Integration
```swift
HealthGoalEngineView()
```
