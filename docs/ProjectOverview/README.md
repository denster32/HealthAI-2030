## üìö Documentation

This project uses DocC for comprehensive API documentation:

```bash
swift package generate-documentation --target "HealthAI 2030" --disable-indexing --output-path ./HealthAI2030DocC
```

### Key Documentation
- **[Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md)** - Detailed system architecture
- **[API Reference](docs/README.md)** - Complete API documentation

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Quick Health Actions
```swift
// Log mood with contextual data
let moodEntry = MoodEntry(mood: .good, context: "After workout")
HealthDataManager.shared.logMood(moodEntry)

// Start guided breathing session
let breathingSession = BreathingSession(duration: 300, pattern: .boxBreathing)
BreathingManager.shared.startSession(breathingSession)

// Record mental state assessment
let mentalState = MentalState(focus: .high, stress: .low, energy: .medium)
MentalHealthManager.shared.recordState(mentalState)
```

### System Intelligence Integration
```swift
// Configure intelligent health automation
let rule = HealthAutomationRule(
    trigger: .heartRateSpike(threshold: 120),
    action: .suggestBreathingExercise,
    conditions: [.notDuringWorkout, .userAvailable]
)
SystemIntelligence.shared.addRule(rule)
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Folder & File Organization

This project follows Apple‚Äôs recommended Xcode organization for clarity, scalability, and maintainability. All files are grouped by function to ensure a logical and future-proof structure.

### Main Structure

```text

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Features/           # Feature modules (e.g., Sleep, SmartHome, Meditation)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <Feature>/     # Each feature contains its Views, ViewModels, Services, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/            # Data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/             # Shared SwiftUI views

```

## iOS 18 Optimizations

- **@Observable Framework**: Replaced traditional `ObservableObject` with the new `@Observable` macro for simplified state management.
- **Swift Concurrency**: Implemented `async`/`await` patterns and structured concurrency throughout the codebase.
- **SwiftData**: Migrated from CoreData to SwiftData for modern persistence and synchronization.
- **Live Activities**: Integrated health monitoring in Dynamic Island and Lock Screen.
- **Interactive Widgets**: Enhanced widget interactions for quick access to health data.

## Release Guide

### Steps to Release

1. **Run validation**

   ```sh
   ./Scripts/validate_release.sh
   ```

   - Ensures test coverage >90% and no unresolved TODOs.

2. **Run release script**

   ```sh
   ./Scripts/release.sh
   ```

   - Runs tests, builds, tags the version, and pushes the tag to origin.

3. **CI/CD**

   - GitHub Actions will build, test, and upload coverage for the new tag.

4. **App Store/TestFlight**

   - For iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS, archive and upload via Xcode Organizer as needed.

5. **Update Changelog**

   - Add any last-minute fixes or notes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
