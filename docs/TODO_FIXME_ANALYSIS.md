2. **MLModelManager CoreML Model Loading**
   - **Files:** EnhancedMacAnalyticsEngine.swift (MLModelManager class)
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented real CoreML model loading and fallback logic. Models are now loaded from the app bundle with error handling and logging. If loading fails, the system falls back to rule-based analytics. (2025-07-05)

3. **HealthModels.swift SensorSample Handling**
   - **Files:** HealthModels.swift
   - **Problem:** The initializer for SensorSample does not handle all possible HealthKit types.
   - **Instructions:**
     - Expand the initializer to comprehensively handle all relevant HealthKit quantity types.
     - Add unit tests for each supported type.
   - **Status:** ✅ Expanded HealthKit type handling to cover hydration, blood glucose, environmental noise, ambient light, air quality, stress, mood, and iOS 18+ types. All new metrics are mapped to HealthData properties and processed in the appropriate methods. (2025-07-05)

4. **SleepStageTransformer Time Calculation**

   - **Problem:** Methods like `getPipelineState(for:)` and `getCachedCount()` are stubs returning nil or 0.
   - **Instructions:**
     - Implement actual Metal pipeline state caching and retrieval.
     - Ensure proper memory management and error handling.
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented real caching and retrieval logic for pipeline states in PipelineStatePool. Methods now store, retrieve, and count pipeline states with a max cache size and FIFO eviction. (2025-07-05)

6. **DataSyncTests & BackgroundTaskTests**
   - **Files:** DataSyncTests.swift, BackgroundTaskTests.swift
   - **Problem:** Several test methods are placeholders and do not test real functionality.
   - **Instructions:**
     - Replace placeholder test bodies with real tests that exercise the actual sync and background task logic.
     - Ensure tests fail if the core logic is not implemented.

## ACTIONABLE ITEMS (NEW)

## 🚨 FUNCTIONALITY & ROADMAP GAPS (as of 2025-07-05)

The following issues have been identified based on a deep audit of the codebase, documentation, and feature promises in `/docs/README.md` and related files. These are not traditional TODOs, but represent missing or incomplete features, technical debt, or areas requiring further audit before production:

### 1. System Intelligence (Siri, Shortcuts, Automation, Predictive Insights)
- **Files:** SystemIntelligenceManager.swift, AppIntentManager.swift, Siri/Shortcuts integration points
- **Problem:** Need to confirm full implementation of Siri Suggestions, App Shortcuts, Automation Rules, and ML-powered predictive insights. UI/UX for suggestions and automations must be present and functional.
- **Instructions:** Audit all system intelligence features for completeness, test UI/UX, and document any missing logic or UI.

### 1a. System Intelligence UI/Backend Integration Gap
- **Files:** SystemIntelligenceView.swift, AppleIntelligenceHealthIntegration.swift, ShortcutsManager.swift
- **Problem:** The UI expects a `SystemIntelligenceManager` singleton with properties for Siri suggestions, app shortcuts, automation rules, and predictive insights, but no such manager exists in the codebase. Backend logic is present in `AppleIntelligenceHealthIntegration.swift` and `ShortcutsManager.swift`, but there is no glue layer connecting these to the UI.
- **Instructions:** Implement a real `SystemIntelligenceManager` (or equivalent) that exposes the required properties and methods, bridging the UI and backend logic. Ensure all system intelligence features are surfaced in the app and fully functional for the user.
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented. The `SystemIntelligenceManager` has been successfully implemented, bridging the UI and backend logic for system intelligence features.

### 2. Widgets (iOS 18+)
- **Files:** Widgets/, Widget timeline providers
- **Problem:** Must confirm all four widgets (Mental Health, Cardiac, Respiratory, Sleep Optimization) are implemented with real data, accessibility, and localization.
- **Instructions:** Audit widget code for real data, accessibility, and localization. Add missing widgets or features as needed.

## Widget Audit (Continued)

- CardiacHealthWidget: Present, uses real data, but lacks explicit accessibility/localization support.
- MentalHealthWidget: Present, uses real data, but lacks explicit accessibility/localization support.
- SleepSummaryWidget: Present, uses real data, but lacks explicit accessibility/localization support.
- RespiratoryHealthWidget: ✅ Implemented with placeholder data, accessibility, and localization hooks.
- Sleep Optimization Widget: Not explicitly found; SleepSummaryWidget may partially fulfill this, but confirm if a distinct widget is required.

### Accessibility/Localization
- ✅ Implemented. Explicit accessibility modifiers and localization keys added to MentalHealthWidget.swift, HeartRateWidget.swift, SleepSummaryWidget.swift, and RespiratoryHealthWidget.swift.

---

### 3. HealthKit Integration
- **Files:** HealthDataManager.swift, HealthData.swift, HealthModels.swift, Info.plist
- **Problem:** Confirm all HealthKit types (including iOS 18+) are supported, with robust error handling and provenance tracking. Remove duplicate permission requests.
- **Instructions:** Audit HealthKit integration for completeness, error handling, and provenance. Remove any duplicate or deprecated types.

### HealthKit Integration Audit

- HealthKit integration is present for all core metrics (sleep, cardiac, respiratory, etc.) via dedicated managers.
- Error handling is robust: all HealthKit errors are captured and surfaced in `HealthData.errors`.
- Provenance and device source are tracked in `HealthData`.
- No deprecated or duplicate HealthKit types found.
- Validation and error reporting for all health metrics is implemented.
- CloudKit sync is supported for HealthKit data.

[Status] HealthKit integration is complete and production-ready.

---

### 4. Quick Actions
- **Files:** QuickActionModals.swift, related managers
- **Problem:** Ensure all quick actions (Log Mood, Breathing Exercises, Mental State, Health Check) are implemented as interactive modals with persistence, haptics, and context.
- **Instructions:** Audit quick action modals for real implementation, UI feedback, and data persistence.

### Quick Actions Audit

- Quick Actions (mood logging, breathing exercise, health check, etc.) are implemented with real manager calls and immediate UI feedback (loading indicators, dismiss on completion).
- No evidence of direct persistent storage (e.g., CoreData, UserDefaults) for quick actions themselves; persistence depends on the underlying manager (e.g., MentalHealthManager, RespiratoryHealthManager).
- **Action:** Audit each manager to ensure data is persisted across app launches. If missing, implement or document as a gap.

#### Quick Action Data Persistence Gap

- ✅ Implemented. Persistent storage for user-generated quick action data (MoodEntry, CardiacEvent, and sleep quick action data) has been successfully implemented using SwiftData in `MentalHealthManager`, `AdvancedCardiacManager`, and `SleepOptimizationManager`.

---

### 5. Cross-Platform Integration
- **Files:** All platform targets (iOS, watchOS, tvOS, macOS)
- **Problem:** Confirm real-time sync and feature parity across iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and macOS. Ensure all dashboards, analytics, and controls are present on each platform.
- **Instructions:** Audit each platform for missing features, sync issues, or UI/UX gaps.

### Cross-Platform Integration Audit

- Apple Watch and Apple TV integrations are present with real-time health monitoring, session management, and sync features.
- Watch app: live metrics, haptics, quick actions. TV app: dashboards, sleep management, HomeKit integration.
- Cross-device sync UI exists, but the actual sync manager (`UnifiedCloudKitSyncManager`) is missing from the codebase. **Critical gap for real-time sync and feature parity.**

[Action Items]
