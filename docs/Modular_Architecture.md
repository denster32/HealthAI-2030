# HealthAI-2030 Modular Architecture Migration Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current `Apps/MainApp` directory exhibits a monolithic structure, lacking clear module boundaries.  This hinders maintainability, scalability, and testability.  The application provides features for cardiac health, sleep tracking, mental health, and smart home integration. These features share common services like data storage and authentication.

## Proposed Modular Architecture

This plan proposes a modular architecture to improve the application's structure.  The application will be divided into the following modules:

* **Core:** Contains fundamental components (data models, networking, core UI).  This module will provide basic functionalities used across all features.  Includes `HealthAI2030Core`, `HealthAI2030Networking`, and `HealthAI2030UI`.

* **Features:** Houses individual features (Cardiac Health, Sleep Tracking, Mental Health, Smart Home Integration). Each feature is a separate submodule. Includes `CardiacHealth`, `SleepTracking`, `MentalHealth`, and `SmartHome` directories.

* **Services:** Contains shared services used by multiple features (data storage, authentication, analytics). Includes the `Services` directory.

* **SharedResources:** Contains shared resources (assets, localization, utility functions). Includes the `SharedResources` directory.


## Dependency Rules

* **Core** is a dependency for all other modules.
* **Features** modules depend on **Core** and **Services**.
* **Services** depends on **Core**.
* **SharedResources** is a dependency for **Core** and **Features**.


## Migration Steps

This migration will be divided into three phases:

**Phase 1: Module Creation and Refactoring (2 weeks)**

* **Milestone 1:** Create the Core module, moving core functionalities from the existing codebase.
* **Milestone 2:** Create the Services module, extracting shared services.
* **Milestone 3:** Create the SharedResources module.
* **Milestone 4:** Refactor existing code to use the new modules.

**Phase 2: Feature Module Migration (4 weeks)**

* **Milestone 5:** Migrate the Cardiac Health feature to its own module.
* **Milestone 6:** Migrate the Sleep Tracking feature to its own module.
* **Milestone 7:** Migrate the Mental Health feature to its own module.
* **Milestone 8:** Migrate the Smart Home Integration feature to its own module.

**Phase 3: Testing and Integration (2 weeks)**

* **Milestone 9:** Thoroughly test each module individually.
* **Milestone 10:** Integrate all modules and perform end-to-end testing.
