# Or run basic tests
./Scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Or run specific test types
./Scripts/test.sh
```

### 2. **Check Test Coverage** (1 minute)

```bash
# View coverage report (after running tests)
open Reports/coverage-report.md

# Or check coverage in Xcode
# Product → Test → Coverage
```

### 3. **Verify Quality Gates** (1 minute)

```bash
# Check quality gate status
cat Reports/test-summary.md

# Look for:
# ✅ All Tests Passed
# ✅ Coverage Threshold Met
# ✅ No Critical Bugs
```

### 4. **Review Test Results** (1 minute)

```bash
# View test results
open Reports/test-summary.md

# Check for any failures or warnings
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Test Results

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- **All Tests Passed:** 100% test success rate
- **Coverage ≥ 85%:** Overall test coverage meets target
- **Quality Gates Passed:** All quality checks successful
- **Performance OK:** Tests complete within time limits

### ⚠️ **Warning Indicators**
- **Coverage < 85%:** Need to add more tests
- **Test Failures:** Some tests are failing
- **Performance Issues:** Tests taking too long
- **Quality Gate Failures:** Quality standards not met

## 🔧 Common Commands

### **Test Execution**
```bash
# Run all tests
./Scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# Run specific test types
./Scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Run individual test file
swift test --filter TestClassName

# Run tests with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

### **Coverage Analysis**
```bash
# Generate coverage report
xcrun xccov view --report TestResults/UnitTests-iOS.xcresult

# View coverage in browser
open Coverage/combined-coverage.txt
```

### **Quality Gates**
```bash
# Check quality gate status
cat Reports/test-summary.md | grep "Quality Gates"

# Verify coverage threshold
cat Reports/coverage-report.md | grep "Overall Coverage"
```

## 🎯 Daily Workflow

### **Morning Routine** (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 2. Run tests
./Scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# 3. Check results
cat Reports/test-summary.md

# 4. Review coverage
cat Reports/coverage-report.md
```

### **Before Committing** (2 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run tests
./Scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# 2. Verify quality gates
cat Reports/test-summary.md | grep "Quality Gates"

# 3. Commit if all green
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### **Weekly Review** (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run full test suite
./Scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# 2. Review coverage trends
cat Reports/coverage-report.md

# 3. Check for new gaps
# Look for areas with < 85% coverage

# 4. Update test strategy
# Add tests for uncovered areas
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Tests Not Running**
```bash
# Check prerequisites
xcodebuild -version
swift --version

# Verify project structure
ls -la Package.swift
ls -la Tests/
```

#### **Coverage Issues**
```bash
# Regenerate coverage
rm -rf Coverage/
./Scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# Check coverage manually
xcrun xccov view --report TestResults/UnitTests-iOS.xcresult
```

#### **Quality Gate Failures**
```bash
# Check specific failures
cat Reports/test-summary.md

# Look for:
# - Test failures
# - Coverage below threshold
# - Performance issues
# - Security violations
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check test execution time
time ./Scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# Look for slow tests
# Consider parallel execution
# Optimize test data
```
