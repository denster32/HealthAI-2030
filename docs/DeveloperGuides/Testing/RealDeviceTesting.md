# Real Device Testing Guide - Background Automation

## 🎯 Objective
Validate that BGTask execution runs analytics/notifications reliably in background on real devices with proper battery/CPU optimization.

## 📱 Test Device Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **iOS 17.0+** (Background Tasks framework features)
- **Physical iPhone** (not simulator - background tasks don't work properly in simulator)
- **iPhone 12 or later** recommended for optimal AI performance
- **Apple Watch Series 6+** (optional, enhances tracking accuracy)

### Optimal Testing Conditions
- **Multiple devices** with different battery levels
- **Various iOS versions** (17.0, 17.1, 17.2+)
- **Different device models** (iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 series)
- **Charging and non-charging scenarios**

## 🔧 Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. App Configuration
```bash
# Ensure Background App Refresh is enabled
Settings > General > Background App Refresh > ON
Settings > General > Background App Refresh > HealthAI 2030 > ON

# Enable notifications
Settings > Notifications > HealthAI 2030 > Allow Notifications > ON
Settings > Notifications > HealthAI 2030 > Critical Alerts > ON

# HealthKit permissions
Settings > Privacy & Security > Health > HealthAI 2030 > All Categories > ON
```

### 2. Developer Tools Setup
```bash
# Install Xcode 15.0+
# Connect device for development
# Enable Developer Mode on device
Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode > ON

# Install Console app for real-time logging
# Configure Instruments for performance monitoring
```

### 3. Logging Configuration
```swift
// Enable verbose logging in debug builds
Logger.isVerboseLoggingEnabled = true

// Enable background task logging
Logger.backgroundTasks.isEnabled = true
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sleep Monitoring Overnight
**Objective**: Verify continuous background analysis during sleep session

**Setup**:
1. Start sleep session before bed (10-11 PM)
2. Place iPhone on bedside table or under pillow
3. Ensure device is charging or has >50% battery
4. Enable Do Not Disturb mode

**Expected Behavior**:
- Sleep analysis tasks execute every 5 minutes
- AI predictions run every 10 minutes
- Data sync occurs every 15 minutes
- Morning report generates between 6-10 AM
- Smart alarm triggers during light sleep phase

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Check Console logs for background execution
# Filter by: "Background task"
# Look for successful completion messages

# Verify morning data in app
# Check sleep timeline shows continuous data
# Confirm morning report is available
# Validate smart alarm triggered (if within wake window)
```

### Scenario 2: Low Battery Optimization
**Objective**: Verify battery optimization prevents excessive drain

**Setup**:
1. Drain device battery to ~25%
2. Start sleep monitoring
3. Do NOT charge device overnight
4. Monitor battery drain rate

**Expected Behavior**:
- Low priority tasks are skipped or delayed
- Only critical tasks (health alerts, smart alarm) execute
- Battery drain <15% over 8 hours
- Sleep analysis continues but less frequently

**Validation Steps**:
```swift
// Check battery optimization level in app
let status = backgroundManager.getDetailedStatus()
XCTAssertEqual(status.batteryOptimizationLevel, .conservative)

// Verify task execution is limited
XCTAssertLessThan(status.stats.aiProcessingExecutions, normalExecutions)
```

### Scenario 3: Charging Optimization
**Objective**: Verify performance mode when charging

**Setup**:
1. Connect device to charger
2. Start sleep monitoring
3. Leave charging overnight

**Expected Behavior**:
- All background tasks execute normally
- AI processing and model updates occur
- Performance mode enables intensive tasks
- No battery concerns

**Validation Steps**:
```swift
// Verify performance mode is active
XCTAssertEqual(status.batteryOptimizationLevel, .performance)

// Check all task types executed
XCTAssertGreaterThan(status.stats.aiProcessingExecutions, 0)
XCTAssertGreaterThan(status.stats.modelUpdateExecutions, 0)
```

### Scenario 4: Critical Health Alert
**Objective**: Verify critical health alerts work in background

**Setup**:
1. Simulate health anomaly (if possible with test data)
2. OR wait for natural anomaly during testing
3. Verify immediate alert delivery

**Expected Behavior**:
- Health alert task executes within 2 minutes
- Critical notification delivered immediately
- Alert bypasses Do Not Disturb (if critical)
- User can respond to alert actions

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Check notification delivery
# Verify alert appears even with DND enabled
# Test alert action buttons work correctly
# Confirm alert is logged in app history
```

### Scenario 5: Background App Termination
**Objective**: Verify tasks continue after app termination

**Setup**:
1. Start sleep monitoring
2. Force quit the app (swipe up in app switcher)
3. Leave device locked overnight
4. Check data continuity in morning

**Expected Behavior**:
- Background tasks continue executing
- Data collection maintains continuity
- Morning report includes full night's data
- No gaps in sleep timeline

**Validation Steps**:
```swift
// Check for data continuity
let sleepData = sleepManager.sleepStageHistory
XCTAssertFalse(hasSignificantGaps(sleepData))

// Verify background execution occurred
XCTAssertGreaterThan(backgroundManager.backgroundTasksExecuted, 0)
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Battery Impact Testing
```bash
# Use Xcode Instruments - Energy Log
# Monitor overnight battery drain
# Target: <15% drain over 8 hours

# Check iOS Battery Settings
Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging
Settings > Battery > Last 24 Hours (check HealthAI usage)
```

### CPU Usage Monitoring
```bash
# Use Xcode Instruments - Activity Monitor
# Monitor CPU spikes during background execution
# Target: Average <5% CPU usage in background

# Check thermal state
# Ensure device doesn't overheat during processing
```

### Memory Usage Tracking
```bash
# Use Xcode Instruments - Allocations
# Monitor memory growth during overnight execution
# Target: <50MB memory increase over 8 hours

# Check for memory leaks
# Ensure proper cleanup after task completion
```

### Network Usage Analysis
```bash
# Monitor cellular/WiFi data usage
# Should be minimal (<1MB overnight for sync)
# Most processing should be on-device
```

e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.healthai.sleep-analysis"]

# Monitor background execution
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.healthai.app" AND category == "BackgroundTasks"'
