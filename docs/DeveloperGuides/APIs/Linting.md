# HealthAI 2030 Linting and Style Guide

This project uses SwiftLint to enforce code style and best practices. All code must pass lint checks before merging.

To run SwiftLint locally:

```sh
brew install swiftlint # if not already installed
swiftlint --strict
```

For rule configuration, see `.swiftlint.yml` in the repository root.

For more details, see the README.md.
