# HealthAI 2030 - Documentation Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for writing high-quality documentation comments in Swift for the HealthAI 2030 project.

## DocC Comment Basics

### Structure
Documentation comments in Swift use the `///` syntax and support markdown formatting.

```swift
/// A brief description of the type, function, or property.
///
/// Provide a more detailed explanation here. Use markdown to enhance readability.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - paramName: Description of the parameter
///
/// - Returns: Description of the return value
///
/// - Throws: Description of potential errors
///
/// - Note: Additional important information
///
/// - SeeAlso: Related types or functions
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clarity and Conciseness
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon
- Explain the purpose and behavior, not just the implementation

### 2. Parameter Documentation
Always document all parameters:
```swift
/// Calculates the health risk score for a given set of parameters.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - medicalHistory: A comprehensive medical history record
///   - geneticData: Genetic information for risk assessment
///   - lifestyleFactors: Current lifestyle and environmental factors
///
/// - Returns: A risk score between 0 and 100
///   - 0-20: Low risk
///   - 21-50: Moderate risk
///   - 51-80: High risk
///   - 81-100: Very high risk
func calculateHealthRiskScore(
    medicalHistory: MedicalHistory, 
    geneticData: GeneticProfile, 
    lifestyleFactors: LifestyleData
) -> RiskScore
```

### 3. Example Usage
Include code examples when helpful:
```swift
/// Represents a quantum health simulation model.
///
/// # Example
/// ```swift
/// let simulator = QuantumHealthSimulator()
/// let result = simulator.runSimulation(
///     parameters: healthParameters,
///     simulationType: .longTermPrediction
/// )
/// print(result.predictedOutcome)
/// ```
class QuantumHealthSimulator {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### 4. Error Handling
Document potential errors and their meanings:
```swift
/// Processes a health dataset for machine learning training.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - dataset: The health dataset to process
///
/// - Throws:
///   - `DataValidationError.insufficientData` if dataset is too small
///   - `DataValidationError.incompatibleFormat` if data format is incorrect
///   - `MachineLearningError.trainingFailure` if model training encounters issues
func processHealthDataset(_ dataset: HealthDataset) throws
```

### 5. Type and Protocol Documentation
Provide context for types and protocols:
```swift
/// A protocol defining the core requirements for health prediction models.
///
/// Implementations of this protocol must provide methods for:
/// - Initializing the model
/// - Training on datasets
/// - Making predictions
/// - Evaluating model performance
///
/// # Design Considerations
/// - Models should be thread-safe
/// - Minimize memory footprint
/// - Support incremental learning
protocol HealthPredictionModel {
    // Protocol requirements
}
```

## Advanced Markdown Features

### Links and References
```swift
/// Connects to the health data aggregation service.
///
/// - SeeAlso: 
///   - ``HealthDataAggregator``
///   - [FHIR Standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)
func connectToHealthService()
```

### Formatting
```swift
/// Represents different health tracking modes.
///
/// - Important: Only one mode can be active at a time.
///
/// # Modes
/// - `passive`: Background tracking with minimal battery impact
/// - `active`: Continuous, high-resolution tracking
enum HealthTrackingMode {
    case passive
    case active
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't repeat method signatures in comments
- Avoid vague descriptions
- Don't document obvious behaviors
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

## Tools and Validation
- Use `swift-doc` for additional documentation generation
- Run the `docc_generation.sh` script to validate documentation coverage
- Aim for at least 80% documentation coverage

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update documentation
- Encourage team feedback on documentation quality
- Consider documentation as a first-class citizen in code reviews
