# Advanced ML/AI Features

- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model training
- On-device inference for low-latency recommendations
- Explainable AI for all major recommendations
- Model versioning and rollback support
- Automated model performance monitoring
- Synthetic data generation for model testing

# Next Steps

- Integrate federated learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow Federated)
- Add on-device CoreML model update logic
- Build explainability UI for users
