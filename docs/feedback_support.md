# Feedback & Support System Documentation

## Overview

The Feedback & Support System in HealthAI 2030 enables users to submit feedback, bug reports, and support tickets directly from the app. It integrates with a backend for real-time support and provides local fallback for offline or failed submissions.

## Features
- User feedback submission (general, bug, suggestion, support)
- Support ticket creation and tracking
- Backend integration for real-time support
- Local fallback for offline/failed submissions
- SwiftUI interface for feedback and support
- History of feedback and tickets

## Usage

### Submitting Feedback
```swift
let entry = FeedbackSupportManager.FeedbackEntry(
    type: .general,
    message: "Great app!",
    email: "user@example.com",
    screenshot: nil
)
FeedbackSupportManager.shared.submitFeedback(entry)
```

### Submitting a Support Ticket
```swift
let ticket = FeedbackSupportManager.SupportTicket(
    subject: "Need help",
    description: "I have an issue.",
    email: "user@example.com"
)
FeedbackSupportManager.shared.submitTicket(ticket)
```

### Viewing Feedback and Tickets
```swift
let feedbacks = FeedbackSupportManager.shared.feedbacks
let tickets = FeedbackSupportManager.shared.tickets
```

### Local Fallback
If backend submission fails, feedback and tickets are saved locally and can be retried later.

### SwiftUI Integration
```swift
FeedbackSupportView()
```

## Best Practices
- Encourage users to provide detailed feedback and bug reports.
- Use email for follow-up if needed.
- Regularly review feedback and tickets for quality improvement.
- Ensure privacy and data protection for all submissions.

## Integration
- Connect the manager to your backend support system via the provided API endpoints.
- Implement push notifications or email alerts for new tickets if needed.
- Use the provided unit tests to ensure reliability.

## Example UI
- FeedbackSupportView provides a tabbed interface for feedback, bug reports, support, and history.
- Users can submit feedback or tickets and view their submission history.

## Troubleshooting
- If submissions fail, check network connectivity and backend status.
- Use local fallback to avoid data loss.
- Review logs for error details.

## Future Enhancements
- Add screenshot/image attachment support.
- Integrate with third-party support platforms (Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc.).
- Enable push notifications for ticket updates.

## Conclusion
The Feedback & Support System ensures users can easily communicate with the development team, improving app quality and user satisfaction.
