## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16.0+
- iOS 18.0+ / macOS 15.0+
- Swift 6.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HealthAI-2030.git
cd "HealthAI 2030"
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
swift build
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
swift test
```

### Development

The project uses Swift Package Manager for dependency management and modular architecture. Each feature module is self-contained and can be developed independently.

```

#### Adding New Features

1. Create a new package in `Packages/`:
```bash
mkdir -p Packages/NewFeature/Sources/NewFeature
```

2. Add the target to `Package.swift`:
```swift
.target(
    name: "NewFeature",
    dependencies: [],
    path: "Packages/NewFeature/Sources/NewFeature"
)
```

3. Add the product:
```swift
.library(
    name: "NewFeature",
    targets: ["NewFeature"]
)
```

## 🧪 Testing
