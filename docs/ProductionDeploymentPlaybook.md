# 8.3 Production Deployment Playbook

## 8.3.1 Release Checklist
The release process follows a strict multi-stage approach:
1. **Code Freeze:** Lock new feature development and merge final bug fixes.
2. **Final QA Pass:** Run the full `Scripts/run_all_tests.sh` suite and manual regression tests on all supported platforms.
3. **Release Candidate Build:** Generate the build with `swift build -c release` and archive with Xcode for iOS distribution.
4. **App Store Metadata Review:** Verify screenshots, descriptions, and compliance information.
5. **Stakeholder Approval:** Obtain sign off from product, security, and compliance leads.
6. **App Store Submission:** Upload via Fastlane or Xcode and await Apple review.

## 8.3.2 Rollback Procedures
If a critical issue is discovered after release:
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Triage the severity and impact with the on-call engineer.
2. **Pull App from Sale:** Temporarily remove the app from the store if necessary.
3. **Revert to Previous Build:** Re-submit the last stable binary using App Store Connect's version management.
4. **Notify Stakeholders:** Alert the team via Slack and email with details of the issue and rollback steps.
5. **Post-Mortem:** Document the root cause and create an action plan to prevent recurrence.

## 8.3.3 Blue-Green & Canary Deployment Strategies
For backend services, we use blue-green deployments to minimize downtime:
1. Deploy the new version to a **green** environment while **blue** serves production traffic.
2. Run smoke tests against the green environment.
3. Switch traffic to green once validation passes; blue becomes the standby.
4. For riskier changes, roll out incrementally using canary instances and monitor metrics before full cutover.

## 8.3.4 A/B Testing Setup & Configuration
A/B tests are orchestrated with our analytics pipeline:
1. Define experiment variants and key metrics in the ExperimentManager.
2. Use remote configuration to assign users to groups at runtime.
3. Collect results via the analytics service and visualize them in the dashboard.
4. Ensure experiments have a clear start and end date to avoid long-term fragmentation.

## 8.3.5 Automated App Store Connect Submission
Fastlane handles automated uploads:
1. `fastlane build` creates the release build and signs the binary.
2. `fastlane deliver` uploads the build, release notes, and screenshots.
3. The pipeline notifies the team on completion and posts the App Store processing status.
