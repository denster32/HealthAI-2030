### Roadmap Tasks

- [x] **Roadmap Task 1.1**: Integrate Automated Performance Tests into CI/CD Pipeline
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.1**: Identify relevant CI/CD workflow file: `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` in `.github/workflows/`.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.2**: Open `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` for editing.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.3**: Add a new job named `performance-tests` after `ui-tests`. This job should run on `macos-latest` and `needs: [unit-tests, integration-tests, ui-tests]`.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.4**: Within the `performance-tests` job, add steps to:
    - [x] Checkout code (`actions/checkout@v4`).
    - [x] Setup Xcode (`maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1`, using `${{ env.XCODE_VERSION }}`).
    - [x] Run performance tests using `xcodebuild test` targeting the `HealthAI2030App` scheme for iOS Simulator.
      - [x] **Specific Command:**
        ```bash
        xcodebuild test \
          -scheme HealthAI2030App \
          -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro,OS=latest' \
          -only-testing:HealthAI2030IntegrationTests/PerformanceTests \
          -derivedDataPath ./DerivedData \
          -resultBundlePath ./PerformanceTestResults.xcresult \
          | xcpretty -c && exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
        ```
    - [x] Upload test results as an artifact (`actions/upload-artifact@v4`). Name: `performance-test-results`. Path: `PerformanceTestResults.xcresult`.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.5**: Save and commit the changes to `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.6**: Push the changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline and verify that the `performance-tests` job runs successfully.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.1.7**: Mark this task complete in this manifest.

- [x] **Roadmap Task 1.2**: Centralize Logging & Establish Unified Metrics Dashboard
  - [x] **Subtask 1.2.1**: **Centralize Logging**:
    - [x] Search the codebase for existing logging implementations (e.g., `os.log`, `print`, custom loggers).
    - [x] Identify key areas (e.g., `AppDelegate.swift`, core managers, networking layer) where logs are generated.
    - [x] For each identified logging point, modify the code to use `os.log` consistently, ensuring appropriate log levels (debug, info, error, fault).
    - [x] Implement a custom `OSLog` wrapper if not already present, to allow for easier future integration with a log aggregation service.
    - [x] **File Examples to Check (Search broadly if not found):**
      - `App/HealthAI2030App/AppHostingController.swift`
      - `Packages/HealthAI2030Core/Sources/HealthAI2030Core/DigitalTwinManager.swift`
      - `Packages/HealthAI2030Networking/Sources/HealthAI2030Networking/NetworkService.swift` (or similar networking files)
      - Files within `Apps/MainApp/Services/`
    - [x] After modifications, run `swift build` and `swift test` to ensure no new errors are introduced.
    - [x] Commit logging changes with a descriptive message.
  - [x] **Subtask 1.2.2**: **Establish Metrics Dashboard (Conceptual for agent)**:
    - [x] **Note to Agent**: This step primarily involves setting up external tools (log aggregation, APM). Your role is to ensure the *application emits the necessary data* for such a dashboard.
    - [x] Research common log aggregation and APM (Application Performance Monitoring) services compatible with Swift/iOS applications (e.g., Datadog, Firebase Crashlytics/Performance Monitoring, Splunk, ELK Stack).
    - [x] **Plan (Do NOT implement external tools)**: Document the *types* of metrics that should be collected (e.g., app launch time, API response times, crash rates, memory usage, CPU usage for Quantum/Federated engines).
    - [x] Add comments or a temporary markdown file (e.g., `METRICS_PLAN.md`) outlining how these metrics *could be collected* from the application (e.g., custom `OSLog` events, `PerformanceMonitor` events).
    - [x] Mark this task complete in this manifest.

- [x] **Roadmap Task 1.3**: DocC Generation Enforcement in CI/CD
  - [x] **Subtask 1.3.1**: Create DocC Generation Script
    - [x] Develop a comprehensive bash script for documentation generation
    - [x] Implement validation for documentation coverage
    - [x] Add checks for missing documentation comments
    - [x] Ensure script works across all project packages
    - [x] Make script executable

  - [x] **Subtask 1.4.1**: Comprehensive Technical Debt Assessment
    - [x] Analyze current codebase for technical debt
    - [x] Identify areas of improvement in code quality, performance, and architecture
    - [x] Create a detailed technical debt assessment document
    - [x] Prioritize technical debt items
    - [x] Develop strategies for incremental improvement
  - [x] **Subtask 1.4.2**: Tools and Process Recommendations
    - [x] Research and recommend code quality tools
    - [x] Suggest performance profiling and optimization strategies
    - [x] Propose dependency management and security scanning tools
    - [x] Define a process for ongoing technical debt management
  - [x] **Subtask 1.4.3**: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
    - [x] Create a comprehensive tech debt assessment document
    - [x] Outline clear improvement strategies
