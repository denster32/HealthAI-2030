# Agent 1 Task Manifest: Security & Dependencies Czar

**Agent:** 1
**Role:** Security & Dependencies Czar
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025

This document outlines your tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on improving the security of the HealthAI-2030 application and managing its dependencies.

## Week 1: Audit and Analysis (July 14-18)

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEC-001 | **Dependency Vulnerability Scan:** Audit all third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities using the Swift Package Manager's `swift package resolve` and `swift package show-dependencies` commands, and by checking against vulnerability databases like the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/). | A report of vulnerable dependencies and a plan for remediation. The report should include the dependency name, version, vulnerability details, and recommended action (e.g., update, replace). |
| SEC-002 | **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Run SAST tools like the Clang Static Analyzer and other available linters to identify security flaws in the codebase. Focus on common Swift vulnerabilities such as those listed in the [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/). | A list of identified vulnerabilities, prioritized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). For each vulnerability, include the file path, line number, and a brief description of the issue. |
| SEC-003 | **Secure Coding Practices Review:** Manually review critical sections of the code for common security issues. Pay close attention to: - Input validation in all user-facing forms and API endpoints. - Data protection mechanisms for sensitive user data (e.g., health information), ensuring proper encryption at rest and in transit. - Authentication and authorization logic. | A document with findings and recommendations for improvement. Provide code snippets to illustrate the issues and suggest corrected implementations. |
| SEC-004 | **Secrets Management Audit:** Ensure no secrets (API keys, credentials, certificates) are hardcoded in the source code. Search the codebase for common patterns of hardcoded secrets. | A report on the state of secrets management. If any hardcoded secrets are found, create a plan to move them to a secure storage solution like the iOS Keychain or a configuration file that is excluded from version control. |

## Week 2: Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25)

Based on the findings from Week 1, you will spend this week implementing the necessary fixes.

| Task ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SEC-FIX-001 | **Update Vulnerable Dependencies:** Apply the remediation plan for vulnerable dependencies. This will likely involve updating package versions in `Package.swift`. |
| SEC-FIX-002 | **Fix High-Priority Vulnerabilities:** Address the critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified by the SAST scan. |
| SEC-FIX-003 | **Implement Secure Coding Recommendations:** Apply the recommended changes from the secure coding review. |
| SEC-FIX-004 | **Migrate Hardcoded Secrets:** Implement the plan to move hardcoded secrets to a secure storage solution. |

Submit all changes as pull requests for review. Good luck!
