# ML Fairness & Bias Analysis Plan

## 1. Identify Sensitive Attributes
- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, education)
- Preexisting health conditions (e.g., chronic disease)

## 2. Fairness Metrics to Evaluate
- Disparate Impact Ratio
- Equal Opportunity Difference
- Demographic Parity
- False Positive/Negative Rate Equality

## 3. Testing Strategy
1. Collect representative, anonymized test datasets stratified by sensitive attributes.
2. Compute fairness metrics for each subgroup.
3. Identify metrics exceeding predefined thresholds (e.g., disparate impact < 0.8).
4. Document findings and adjust model thresholds or inputs.

## 4. Reporting
- Summarize metrics in tabular form per subgroup.
- Visualize metric distributions (bar charts, box plots).
- Provide clear recommendations for mitigating identified biases.
