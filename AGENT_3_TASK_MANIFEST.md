# Agent 3 Task Manifest: Code Quality & Refactoring Champion

**Agent:** 3
**Role:** Code Quality & Refactoring Champion
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025

This document outlines your tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on improving the overall code health of the HealthAI-2030 application, making it more readable, maintainable, and consistent.

## Week 1: Audit and Analysis (July 14-18)

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QUAL-001 | **Code Style and Linting Enforcement:** Configure and run SwiftLint across the entire codebase. Define a shared `.swiftlint.yml` configuration file based on community best practices (e.g., the [Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)). | A pull request with the `.swiftlint.yml` configuration file and any initial, auto-correctable style fixes. Also, a report of the major style violations that require manual intervention. |
| QUAL-002 | **Code Complexity Analysis and Refactoring:** Use tools and manual inspection to identify "code smells" such as long methods, large classes, and high cyclomatic complexity. Pay special attention to the Core Data stack, networking layer, and any complex business logic. | A prioritized list of areas that require refactoring. For each area, provide a brief explanation of the problem and a proposed refactoring strategy (e.g., "Extract Method," "Decompose Class"). |
| QUAL-003 | **API Design and Consistency Review:** Review internal and public APIs for consistency, clarity, and adherence to Swift API Design Guidelines. Check for consistent naming conventions, parameter ordering, and use of value types vs. reference types. | A document with recommendations for API improvements. This should include a list of specific APIs to be changed and the proposed new signature. |
| QUAL-004 | **Documentation Audit and Improvement:** Audit existing documentation, including in-code comments (especially `// MARK:` comments), READMEs, and any external documentation in the `/docs` directory. Check for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. | A report on the state of the documentation, highlighting missing or outdated information. Create a plan for improving the documentation during the remediation week. |

## Week 2: Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25)

Based on the findings from Week 1, you will spend this week implementing the necessary improvements.

| Task ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QUAL-FIX-001 | **Fix Linting Issues:** Manually address the remaining SwiftLint violations. |
| QUAL-FIX-002 | **Refactor High-Priority Code:** Begin refactoring the most critical areas identified in the complexity analysis. |
| QUAL-FIX-003 | **Improve API Consistency:** Apply the recommended changes to improve API design. |
| QUAL-FIX-004 | **Update and Improve Documentation:** Execute the documentation improvement plan. This includes adding missing comments, updating READMEs, and clarifying confusing sections. |

Submit all changes as pull requests for review. Good luck!
