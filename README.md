**A multi-platform health and wellness application for iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS.**

HealthAI 2030 is a forward-looking application designed to provide users with deep, actionable health insights by leveraging cutting-edge technologies. It integrates advanced analytics, machine learning, augmented reality, and smart home automation to create a holistic and personalized health companion.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Health Analytics:** Deep analysis of sleep, cardiac, respiratory, and mental health data. [Learn more ‚Üí Sleep Stage Classification Model](docs/SleepStageClassifier.md)
- **AI Health Coach:** Personalized recommendations and proactive nudges powered by machine learning.
- **Multi-Platform Experience:** Seamless integration across iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac.
- **AR Health Visualizer:** Augmented Reality visualizations of health data.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Optimizes the user's environment (e.g., lighting, temperature) for better sleep and wellness.
- **Biofeedback & Meditation:** Guided exercises for stress reduction and mental clarity.
- **Federated Learning:** Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning.
- **Extensible AI:** A "Copilot" skill system allows for easy expansion of AI capabilities.
- **Skill Marketplace:** Discover and enable new Copilot skills in-app.
- **User Customization:** Script your own automations and analytics pipelines.
- **WidgetKit & Shortcuts:** Widgets and Siri Shortcuts for quick actions and insights.
- **Third-Party API Support:** Integrate with Google Fit, Fitbit, and more.
- **Explainable AI:** Transparent, user-facing explanations for recommendations.
- **Data Privacy Dashboard:** Full control and transparency over your health data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

The project is architected for scalability and maintainability, with a clear separation of concerns.

- **UI:** Built with SwiftUI for a modern, declarative user interface.
- **State Management:** Follows MVVM-like patterns, with `Managers` serving as ViewModels or service layers.
- **Modularity:** Code is organized into feature-based modules (e.g., `Analytics`, `ML`, `Biofeedback`).
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes Core Data (`.xcdatamodeld`) and CloudKit for synchronization.
- **High-Performance Computing:** Leverages Metal for custom chart rendering and the Neural Engine for on-device ML.
- **API Documentation:** [View DocC documentation](docs/architecture.png) (coming soon).

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- macOS with the latest version of Xcode.
- Swift Package Manager for dependency management.
- An Apple Developer account for certain capabilities (e.g., HealthKit).

### Build & Run

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2.  Open `HealthAI 2030.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Select the desired target (e.g., `HealthAI 2030` for iOS) and a simulator or device.
4.  Click the **Run** button (or `Cmd+R`).

## üß™ Running Tests

The project includes unit, performance, and UI tests. To run them:
1.  Open the Test Navigator in Xcode (`Cmd+6`).
2.  Click the **Play** button next to a test suite (e.g., `HealthAI 2030Tests` or `HealthAI 2030UITests`) to run all tests.
3.  You can also run individual test files or functions.
4.  Snapshot/UI and property-based tests are included for robust quality.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `HealthAI 2030/`: The main application target containing shared code.
- `HealthAI 2030 WatchKit App/`: watchOS application target.
- `HealthAI 2030 macOS/`: macOS application target.
- `HealthAI 2030 tvOS/`: tvOS application target.
- `Packages/`: Modular Swift packages for Analytics, ML, Audio, etc.
- `Scripts/`: Helper scripts for build phases, linting, and maintenance.
- `Tests/`: A collection of non-Xcode-target tests.
- `docs/`: Architecture diagrams and API documentation.
