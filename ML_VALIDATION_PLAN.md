# Model Performance Validation Plan

## 1. Expand Offline Evaluation Datasets
- Gather anonymized real-world datasets across demographics (age, gender, region).
- Ensure inclusion of edge cases (missing values, noisy data).

## 2. Cross-Validation & Robustness
- Implement k-fold cross-validation (e.g., k=5) within a Swift-based pipeline or server-side script.
- Evaluate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) across folds.
- Test model robustness to noisy inputs by adding random perturbations.

## 3. CI/CD Integration
- Automate validation scripts to run on each model update.
- Fail CI if performance drops beyond defined regression threshold.
