            - [x] **Action:** Increase the number of concurrent operations in `testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes` (e.g., from 5,000 to 50,000 operations).
            - [x] **Action:** Add assertions to `testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes` to check for data integrity (e.g., count, non-nil values) after a large number of random updates/deletes.
            - [x] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataManagerTests/testConcurrentSaves`
            - [x] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataManagerTests/testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes`
            - [x] **Verification:** Ensure both tests pass consistently without crashes or data corruption. Observe memory usage during tests.
        - [x] **1.1.1.3 Implement Long-Duration Data Persistence Test:**

            - [x] **Action:** Add a new test method (e.g., `testLongDurationDataPersistence`) that continuously saves, updates, and deletes a large volume of data (e.g., 1000 records per minute) over an extended period (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour).
            - [x] **Action:** Include assertions to check data consistency at regular intervals and at the end of the test.
            - [x] **Action:** Monitor for memory leaks during the test (conceptual for agent - would require Instruments/Xcode, but agent can note this).
            - [x] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataStressTests/testLongDurationDataPersistence`
            - [x] **Verification:** Test passes, no crashes, memory usage is stable over time.

            - [x] **Action:** Add test methods for each migration path:
                - `testMigrationFromV1ToVLatest()`: Load data created with SchemaV1, then migrate to the latest schema.
                - `testMigrationFromV2ToVLatest()`: Load data created with SchemaV2, then migrate to the latest schema.
                - `testSchemaEvolutionWithNewField()`: Simulate adding a new optional field to a model and ensure existing data loads correctly.

            - [x] **Action:** Re-examine `testCloudKitConflictResolution()` in `Apps/Tests/UnitTests/SwiftDataManagerTests.swift` and extend it.
            - [x] **Action:** Introduce more complex conflict scenarios (e.g., multiple devices modifying the same record simultaneously, a device coming online after a long period with significant local changes).
            - [x] **Action:** Validate the conflict resolution logic (e.g., "last write wins," "client wins," or custom merge logic) for *all* relevant data models.
