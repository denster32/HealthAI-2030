            - [ ] **Action:** Increase the number of concurrent operations in `testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes` (e.g., from 5,000 to 50,000 operations).
            - [ ] **Action:** Add assertions to `testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes` to check for data integrity (e.g., count, non-nil values) after a large number of random updates/deletes.
            - [ ] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataManagerTests/testConcurrentSaves`
            - [ ] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataManagerTests/testConcurrentUpdatesAndDeletes`

        - [ ] **1.1.1.3 Implement Long-Duration Data Persistence Test:**
            - [ ] **File:** `Apps/Tests/PerformanceTests.swift` (or create a new `SwiftDataStressTests.swift` in `Apps/Tests/Performance/`)
            - [ ] **Action:** Add a new test method (e.g., `testLongDurationDataPersistence`) that continuously saves, updates, and deletes a large volume of data (e.g., 1000 records per minute) over an extended period (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour).
            - [ ] **Action:** Include assertions to check data consistency at regular intervals and at the end of the test.
            - [ ] **Action:** Monitor for memory leaks during the test (conceptual for agent - would require Instruments/Xcode, but agent can note this).
            - [ ] **Command:** `swift test --filter SwiftDataStressTests/testLongDurationDataPersistence`
            - [ ] **Verification:** Test passes, no crashes, memory usage is stable over time.

            - [ ] **Rationale:** To simulate real-world app updates and data migrations.
        - [ ] **1.1.2.3 Implement Migration Test Cases:**
            - [ ] **File:** `Apps/Tests/IntegrationTests/DataMigrationTests.swift` (create if not exists)
            - [ ] **Action:** Add test methods for each migration path:
                - `testMigrationFromV1ToVLatest()`: Load data created with SchemaV1, then migrate to the latest schema.
                - `testMigrationFromV2ToVLatest()`: Load data created with SchemaV2, then migrate to the latest schema.
                - `testSchemaEvolutionWithNewField()`: Simulate adding a new optional field to a model and ensure existing data loads correctly.
                - `testSchemaEvolutionWithRenamedField()`: Simulate renaming a field using `@Migration` and ensure data loads.

            - [ ] **Rationale:** To test how the app responds to unexpected database states.
            - [ ] **Verification:** Observe application behavior (crash, recovery, data loss). The goal is graceful failure or recovery, not necessarily perfect data recovery without user intervention for severe corruption.
        - [ ] **1.1.3.2 Implement Checksum/Integrity Checks for Critical Data:**

            - [ ] **Action:** Re-examine `testCloudKitConflictResolution()` in `Apps/Tests/UnitTests/SwiftDataManagerTests.swift` and extend it.
            - [ ] **Action:** Introduce more complex conflict scenarios (e.g., multiple devices modifying the same record simultaneously, a device coming online after a long period with significant local changes).
            - [ ] **Action:** Validate the conflict resolution logic (e.g., "last write wins," "client wins," or custom merge logic) for *all* relevant data models.
            - [ ] **Action:** Document the chosen conflict resolution strategy explicitly.
            - [ ] **Verification:** Ensure conflicts are resolved predictably and data loss is minimized.
        - [ ] **1.1.4.3 Long-Term Offline Sync Queuing:**
            - [ ] **Action:** Design and test a scenario where a device remains offline for an extended period (e.g., days or weeks) with significant accumulated local data changes.

            - [ ] **Action:** Ensure all network requests are wrapped in `do-catch` blocks and use a custom `AppError` enum for network-related errors (e.g., `AppError.networkOffline`, `AppError.timeout`, `AppError.serverError(statusCode: Int, message: String)`).
            - [ ] **Action:** Provide user-friendly error messages for each error type.
            - [ ] **Verification:** Manually (or using network proxy tools) simulate various network conditions (offline, slow network, server unreachable) and observe error messages.
