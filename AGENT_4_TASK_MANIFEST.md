# Agent 4 Task Manifest: Testing & Reliability Engineer

**Agent:** 4
**Role:** Testing & Reliability Engineer
**Sprint:** July 14-25, 2025

This document outlines your tasks for the two-week code audit and remediation sprint. Your primary focus is on improving the test coverage, fixing bugs, and ensuring the reliability of the HealthAI-2030 application across all platforms.

## Week 1: Audit and Analysis (July 14-18)

| Task ID | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEST-001 | **Test Coverage Analysis:** Use Xcode's code coverage tools to measure the current test coverage for both unit tests and UI tests. Identify critical areas of the application with low or no test coverage, such as business logic, data models, and utility classes. | A test coverage report detailing the coverage percentage for each module and a prioritized list of areas that need improved test coverage. |
| TEST-002 | **UI Test Automation Review and Enhancement:** Review the existing UI test suite (`XCUITest`). Identify flaky tests, improve test assertions, and expand the suite to cover more user flows. Pay special attention to tests for new features and critical user journeys. | A report on the state of the UI test suite, including a list of flaky tests and a plan for improving them. |
| TEST-003 | **Bug Triage and Prioritization:** Review the existing bug backlog in the project's issue tracker. Reproduce reported issues to confirm their validity, and prioritize them based on severity and user impact. | An updated and prioritized bug backlog. Each bug should have clear steps to reproduce, an assigned priority, and be ready for a developer to work on. |
| TEST-004 | **Cross-platform Consistency Testing:** Manually test the application on all supported platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS) to ensure a consistent user experience and identify any platform-specific bugs. | A report on any inconsistencies or platform-specific bugs found during testing. For each issue, include screenshots or videos and detailed steps to reproduce. |

## Week 2: Remediation and Implementation (July 21-25)

Based on the findings from Week 1, you will spend this week implementing the necessary improvements.

| Task ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TEST-FIX-001 | **Increase Test Coverage:** Write new unit tests for the critical areas identified in the coverage analysis. |
| TEST-FIX-002 | **Improve UI Tests:** Implement the plan to improve the UI test suite, fixing flaky tests and adding new ones. |
| TEST-FIX-003 | **Fix High-Priority Bugs:** Begin fixing the high-priority bugs from the newly triaged backlog. |
| TEST-FIX-004 | **Address Platform Inconsistencies:** Work with the team to address the platform-specific issues identified during testing. |

Submit all changes as pull requests for review. Good luck!
