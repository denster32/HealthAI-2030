# HealthAI 2030 Automated Agent Manifest

## Agent Role
You are an autonomous DevOps and development agent for the HealthAI 2030 project. Your mission is to execute the following 12 major tasks, one at a time, following best coding practices, Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), and industry-standard DevOps workflows. After each task, open a pull request with a clear summary and await review before proceeding.

## 12 Major Tasks

1. **Complete Modular Migration**
   - Execute and, if needed, expand `Scripts/migrate_files.sh` to fully reorganize the codebase into modular Swift frameworks.
   - Ensure all code, resources, and documentation are moved to their correct modules.
   - Update all imports and references project-wide.
   - Confirm the project builds and runs after migration.

2. **Establish Core Data Architecture**
   - Design and implement a robust Core Data stack within the `HealthAI2030Core` framework.
   - Migrate all existing data models and persistence logic.
   - Ensure thread safety, data integrity, and performance.
   - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.

3. **Develop Comprehensive User Profile System**
   - Architect and implement a full-featured user profile system.
   - Include profile creation, editing, avatar upload, and health goal management.
   - Integrate with authentication and data storage.
   - Ensure UI/UX follows Apple HIG and is fully accessible.

4. **Integrate Advanced Sleep Tracking**
   - Move all sleep tracking logic into `SleepIntelligenceKit`.
   - Expand to support multiple data sources (Apple Health, wearables).
   - Implement analytics and visualizations for sleep trends.
   - Add user-facing dashboards and notifications.

5. **Implement Security & Privacy Framework**
   - Centralize all security and privacy logic in `SecurityComplianceKit`.
   - Add biometric authentication, secure data storage, and permission management.
   - Build a privacy settings UI for user control.
   - Conduct a security audit and address vulnerabilities.

6. **Create Modular Dashboard Architecture**
   - Refactor the dashboard into a modular, widget-based system.
   - Allow easy addition/removal of health widgets (sleep, activity, nutrition, etc.).
   - Ensure smooth navigation and responsive design.
   - Follow Apple HIG for dashboard and widget design.

7. **Automate CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up or enhance GitHub Actions (or similar) for automated builds, linting, testing, and deployment.
   - Ensure all PRs trigger the pipeline and block merges on failure.
   - Add automated code formatting and static analysis.

8. **Expand Health Data Integrations**
   - Integrate with Apple HealthKit and at least one third-party wearable API.
   - Design a scalable architecture for adding new data sources.
   - Ensure data synchronization and conflict resolution.

9. **Implement Notification & Reminder System**
   - Build a robust local and push notification system for health reminders and insights.
   - Allow users to customize notification preferences.
   - Ensure notifications are actionable and respect user privacy.

10. **Overhaul Documentation & Developer Onboarding**
    - Consolidate all documentation in the `Docs/` directory.
    - Update the README with architecture diagrams, setup, and contribution guides.
    - Add onboarding scripts and sample data for new developers.

11. **Conduct Accessibility & HIG Compliance Audit**
    - Review all UI/UX for accessibility (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, color contrast).
    - Ensure every screen and interaction follows Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.
    - Address all identified issues and document compliance.

12. **Prepare for App Store Submission**
    - Review and update all app metadata, icons, and screenshots.
    - Ensure compliance with App Store policies.
    - Conduct final QA, resolve blockers, and prepare a release candidate build.

## Pull Request Workflow

- After each task, create a new branch and open a pull request to `main`.
- Title PRs as: `Task X: [Short Description]`
- Summarize changes, reference related issues, and confirm all checks passed.
- Wait for review and approval before starting the next task.

---

## Standards & Best Practices

- **Atomic Commits:** Only include changes related to the current task.
- **Traceability:** Log all actions for auditing.
- **CI/CD Compliance:** Ensure all PRs pass automated checks before merging.
- **Apple HIG:** All UI/UX must comply with Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.
- **Rollback Plan:** If migration or refactoring fails, provide a summary and instructions to revert.
