## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Agent Troubleshooting & Workflow Issues

### Known Agent Struggles:
1. **Difficulty checking off completed tasks** - Agent often fails to update `[ ]` to `[x]` in this file
2. **GitHub update failures** - Agent struggles to push changes and create PRs after each task
3. **Task completion tracking** - Agent may complete work but not mark it as done
4. **Branch management issues** - Agent may not create proper feature branches

### Required Workflow Fixes:
**BEFORE starting any task:**
- Always check current git status: `git status`
- Ensure you're on the correct branch: `git branch`
- If not on a feature branch, create one: `git checkout -b feature/task-X-description`

**AFTER completing each task:**
- Stage all changes: `git add .`
- Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Task X: [Description] - Complete"`
- Push to remote: `git push --set-upstream origin feature/task-X-description`
- **CRITICAL**: Update this file to mark task as complete: `[x]` instead of `[ ]`
- Create PR on GitHub (if automated PR creation fails, do it manually)

**If GitHub push fails:**
- Check remote: `git remote -v`
- Try: `git push origin feature/task-X-description`
- If still fails, save work locally and notify user

## Agent Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: Can't check off tasks in markdown**
- Solution: Use `[x]` instead of `[ ]` to mark complete
- Alternative: Add ‚úÖ emoji after task description
- Backup: Create a separate completion log file

**Issue: GitHub push fails**
- Check: `git remote -v` to verify remote URL
- Try: `git push origin feature/branch-name`
- If fails: Save work locally and notify user immediately

**Issue: Can't create pull requests**
- Manual PR creation: Go to GitHub.com ‚Üí repository ‚Üí "Compare & pull request"
- Alternative: Use GitHub CLI: `gh pr create --title "Task X: Description"`

**Issue: Build failures**
- Clean build: `xcodebuild clean`
- Reset derived data: Delete `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- Check dependencies: `swift package resolve`

**Issue: Task completion tracking**
- Create completion log: `TASK_COMPLETION_LOG.md`
- Update both this file AND the log file
- Use timestamps for all completion entries

---

## Standards & Best Practices

- **Atomic Commits:** Only include changes related to the current task.
- **Traceability:** Log all actions for auditing.
- **CI/CD Compliance:** Ensure all PRs pass automated checks before merging.
- **Apple HIG:** All UI/UX must comply with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
- **Rollback Plan:** If migration or refactoring fails, provide a summary and instructions to revert.
