# HealthAI 2030 - Technical Debt Backlog Q1 2025

## Overview
This document tracks technical debt items identified during the ongoing development of the HealthAI 2030 project. Each item is categorized, prioritized, and includes potential mitigation strategies.

## Prioritization Levels
- ðŸ”´ High Priority: Immediate action required
- ðŸŸ  Medium Priority: Address in the next sprint
- ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority: Consider during future refactoring

## Technical Debt Items

### 1. Logging Standardization Improvements ðŸŸ 
- **Description**: While logging was centralized in Phase 1, there might be inconsistencies in log levels and context across different modules.
- **Impact**: Reduced observability and potential performance overhead
- **Proposed Action**: 
  - Conduct a comprehensive audit of logging implementations
  - Create a detailed logging style guide
  - Implement automated linting for log statements

### 2. Dependency Vulnerability Assessment ðŸ”´
- **Description**: Need for a systematic approach to tracking and updating dependencies
- **Impact**: Potential security risks from outdated packages
- **Proposed Action**:
  - Implement automated dependency scanning
  - Set up quarterly dependency review process
  - Create a script to generate dependency health reports

### 3. Performance Optimization in Quantum Computing Modules ðŸŸ 
- **Description**: Initial implementation of quantum computing integration may have performance bottlenecks
- **Impact**: Potential slowdowns in advanced health prediction features
- **Proposed Action**:
  - Profile quantum computing module performance
  - Identify and optimize computational bottlenecks
  - Consider alternative algorithm implementations

### 4. Test Coverage Gaps ðŸŸ 
- **Description**: Potential gaps in test coverage, especially for complex workflows
- **Impact**: Reduced confidence in code reliability
- **Proposed Action**:
  - Generate comprehensive test coverage report
  - Identify and create tests for critical path scenarios
  - Implement mutation testing to validate test effectiveness

### 5. Documentation Consistency ðŸŸ¢
- **Description**: Potential inconsistencies in documentation across different modules
- **Impact**: Reduced developer productivity and onboarding efficiency
- **Proposed Action**:
  - Develop a documentation template
  - Conduct a documentation audit
  - Create guidelines for maintaining documentation

## Tracking
